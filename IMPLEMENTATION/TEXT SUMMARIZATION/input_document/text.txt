NEED OF THE PROTOCOLS:
 
If a single administrator wants to access 100 routers and local database of the device is 
used for username and password (authentication) then the administrator have to make the 
same user account different times. Also, if he wants to keep different usernam
e and 
password for the devices then he have to manually change the authentication for the 

 
To ease this task to some extent, ACS (Access Control Server) is used. ACS provides a 
centralised management system in which t
he database of username and password are 
kept. Also, authorization (means what the user is authorised to do) can be configured. But 
for this we have to tell the router to refer to ACS for its decision on authentication and 
authorization.

RADIUS 

 
 
RADIUS, stands for 
Remote Authentication Dial In User 
S

, is a security protocol 
used in AAA framework to provide centralised authentication for users who want to gain 
access to the network. 
 
Features 

 
Some of the features of RADIUS are: 
 
1.
 
Open standard protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between any ven
dor 
device and Cisco ACS server. 
 
2.
 
It uses UDP as transmission protocol. 
 
3.
 
It uses UDP port number 1812 for authentication and authorisation and 1813 for 
accounting. 
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using RADIUS then only the passwords of AAA 
packets are enc
rypted. 
 
5.
 
No explicit command authorization can be implemented. 
 
6.
 
In RADIUS, authentication and authorization are coupled together. 
 
 
 
 
 
Working 

 
 
When other device want to access Network Access Server (NAS

will send access

request message to ACS server for the matching the credentials. In 
response to the access

request of the client, the ACS server will provide an 
accessaccept
 
message to the client if the credentials are valid and access

reject if the 
credentials do not match.

TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System) is an older authentication 
protocol common to UNIX networks that allows a remote access server to forward a user's 
log
i
n password to an authentication server to determine whether access can be allowed to 
a given system. TACACS is an encryption protocol and therefore less secure than the later

Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access
-
Control System Plus (TACACS+) are two common security protocols used to provide 
centralized access into networks. RADIUS was designed to authenticate and log remote
 
network users, while TACACS+ is most commonly used for administrator access to 
network devices like routers and switches. Both protocols provide centralized 
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for computers that 
connect and use 
a network service. 
 
Authentication 
-
 
Who is allowed to gain access to the network? Traditionally authorized users 
provide a username and password to verify their identity for both RADIUS and TACACS+
 
Authorization 
-
 
What services can a user access once they
 
are authenticated? It is unlikely 
that you want your finance people to have access to the developer database. Visitors may 
have access only to the Internet, while only IT staff can access the entire passwords 
database. 
 
 
 
Accounting 
-
 
What services did each user access and for how long? Accounting records 
record the user's identification, network address, point of attachment and a unique 
session identifier

these statistics are tracked and added to 
 

is useful when time on the system is billed to individuals or 
departments
.
 
 
Features
 

 
Some of the features of TACACS+ are:
 
1.
 
Cisco proprietary protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between the Cisco device 
and Cisco ACS server.
 
2.
 
It uses TCP as transmiss
ion protocol.
 
3.
 
It uses TCP port number 49.
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using TACACS+ then all the AAA packets exchanged 
between them are encrypted.
 
5.
 
It separates AAA into distinct elements i.e
 
authentication, authorisation and accounting 
are separated.
 
6.
 
It provides greater granular control (than RADIUS) as the commands that are authorised 
to be used by the user can be specified.
 
7.
 
It provides accounting support but less extensive than RADIUS.
 
Work
ing
 

 
The client of the TACACS+ is called Network Access Device (Nad) or Network Access 
Server (NAS).Network
 
Access Device will contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a 
username prompt through
 
CONTINUE
 
message . The user then enters a username and the 
Network Access Device again contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a password prompt 
(Continue message) displaying t
he password prompt to the user, the user enters a 
password, and the password is then sent to the TACACS+ server.
 
 
The server can respond with one of the following reply messages:
 

 
If the credentials entered are valid then the TACACS+ server will response wi
th an 
ACCEPT message.
 

 
If the credentials entered are not valid then the TACACS+ server will response with an 
REJECT message.
 

 
If the link between the TACACS+ server and NAS or TACACS+ server is not working 
properly then it will respond with an ERROR message
.
 

 
If TACACS+ authorization is required, the TACACS+ server is again contacted and it 
returns an ACCEPT or REJECT authorization response. If the ACCEPT message is 
returned, it contains attributes which are used to determine services that a user is 
allowed t
o do.
 
For accounting, the client will send a REQUEST message to the TACACS+ server for which 
the Server responds with RESPONSE message stating that record is received.
 
Advantage
 

 
1.
 
Provides greater granular control than RADIUS.TACACS+ allows a 
network 
administrator to define what commands a user may run.
 
2.
 
All the AAA packets are encrypted rather just passwords (in case of Radius).
 
3.
 
TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP. TCP guarantees communication between the 
client and server.
 
Disadvantage
 

 
1.
 
As it is 
Cisco proprietary, therefore it can be used between the Cisco devices only.
 
2.
 
Less extensive support for accounting than RADIUS.

returns an ACCEPT or REJECT authorization response. If the ACCEPT message is 
returned, it contains attributes which are used to determine services that a user is 
allowed t

For accounting, the client will send a REQUEST message to the TACACS+ server for which 
the Server responds with RESPONSE message stating that record is received.
 
Advantage
 

 
1.

network 
administrator to define what commands a user may run.
 
2.

3.
 
TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP. TCP guarantees communication between the 
client and server.
 
Disadvantage
 

 
1.
 
As it is 
Cisco proprietary, therefore it can be used between the Cisco devices only.
 
2.
 
Less extensive support for accounting than RADIUS.

Control System Plus (TACACS+) are two common security protocols used to provide 
centralized access into networks. RADIUS was designed to authenticate and log remote
 
network users, while TACACS+ is most commonly used for administrator access to 
network devices like routers and switches. Both protocols provide centralized 
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for computers that 
connect and use 
a network service. 
 
Authentication

Who is allowed to gain access to the network? Traditionally authorized users 
provide a username and password to verify their identity for both RADIUS and TACACS+
 
Authorization

It provides greater granular control (than RADIUS) as the commands that are authorised 
to be used by the user can be specified.
 
7.
 
It provides accounting support but less extensive than RADIUS.
 
Work
ing
 

 
The client of the TACACS+ is called Network Access Device (Nad) or Network Access 
Server (NAS).Network
 
Access Device will contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a 
username prompt through
 
CONTINUE
 
message . The user then enters a username and the 
Network Access Device again contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a password prompt 
(Continue message) displaying t
he password prompt to the user, the user enters a 
password, and the password is then sent to the TACACS+ server.
 
 
The server can respond with one of the following reply messages:
 

 
If the credentials entered are valid then the TACACS+ server will response wi
th an 
ACCEPT message.
 

 
If the credentials entered are not valid then the TACACS+ server will response with an 
REJECT message.
 

 
If the link between the TACACS+ server and NAS or TACACS+ server is not working 
properly then it will respond with an ERROR message
.
 

 
If TACACS+ authorization is required, the TACACS+ server is again contacted and it 
returns an ACCEPT or REJECT authorization response. If the ACCEPT message is 
returned, it contains attributes which are used to determine services that a user is 
allowed t
o do.
 
For accounting, the client will send a REQUEST message to the TACACS+ server for which 
the Server responds with RESPONSE message stating that record is received.
 
Advantage
 

 
1.
 
Provides greater granular control than RADIUS.TACACS+ allows a 
network 
administrator to define what commands a user may run.
 
2.
 
All the AAA packets are encrypted rather just passwords (in case of Radius).
 
3.
 
TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP. TCP guarantees communication between the 
client and server.
 
Disadvantage
 

 
1.
 
As it is 
Cisco proprietary, therefore it can be used between the Cisco devices only.
 
2.
 
Less extensive support for accounting than RADIUS.

Aim: 
Study of various Authentication and access control services such as Radius, 
Tacacs and Tacacs+ 
 
 
Theory: 
 
NEED OF THE PROTOCOLS:
 
If a single administrator wants to access 100 routers and local database of the device is 
used for username and password (authentication) then the administrator have to make the 
same user account different times. Also, if he wants to keep different usernam
e and 
password for the devices then he have to manually change the authentication for the 

 
To ease this task to some extent, ACS (Access Control Server) is used. ACS provides a 
centralised management system in which t
he database of username and password are 
kept. Also, authorization (means what the user is authorised to do) can be configured. But 
for this we have to tell the router to refer to ACS for its decision on authentication and 
authorization. 
 
Two protocols are
 

 
1.
 
TACACS+ 
 
2.
 
R
ADIUS
 
RADIUS 

 
 
RADIUS, stands for 
Remote Authentication Dial In User 
S
ervice
, is a security protocol 
used in AAA framework to provide centralised authentication for users who want to gain 
access to the network. 
 
Features 

 
Some of the features of RADIUS are: 
 
1.
 
Open standard protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between any ven
dor 
device and Cisco ACS server. 
 
2.
 
It uses UDP as transmission protocol. 
 
3.
 
It uses UDP port number 1812 for authentication and authorisation and 1813 for 
accounting. 
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using RADIUS then only the passwords of AAA 
packets are enc
rypted. 
 
5.
 
No explicit command authorization can be implemented. 
 
6.
 
In RADIUS, authentication and authorization are coupled together. 
 
 
 
 
 
Working 

 
 
When other device want to access Network Access Server (NAS
-
client of RADIUS ), it 
will send access
-
request message to ACS server for the matching the credentials. In 
response to the access
-
request of the client, the ACS server will provide an 
accessaccept
 
message to the client if the credentials are valid and access
-
reject if the 
credentials do not match.

Advantage 

 
 
1.
 
As it is open standard, therefore it can be used between the other 
devices also. 
 
Disadvantage 

 
 
1
 
As RADIUS uses UDP 
.
 
2
 
No explicit command authorization can be implemented.

Tacas:  
 
TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System) is an older authentication 
protocol common to UNIX networks that allows a remote access server to forward a user's 
log
i
n password to an authentication server to determine whether access can be allowed to 
a given system. TACACS is an encryption protocol and therefore less secure than the later 
TACACS+ and Remote Authentication Dial
-
In User Service protocols.  
 
 
 
 
 
Tacacs+: 
 
Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access
-
Control System Plus (TACACS+) are two common security protocols used to provide 
centralized access into networks. RADIUS was designed to authenticate and log remote
 
network users, while TACACS+ is most commonly used for administrator access to 
network devices like routers and switches. Both protocols provide centralized 
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for computers that 
connect and use 
a network service. 
 
Authentication 
-
 
Who is allowed to gain access to the network? Traditionally authorized users 
provide a username and password to verify their identity for both RADIUS and TACACS+
 
Authorization 
-
 
What services can a user access once they
 
are authenticated? It is unlikely 
that you want your finance people to have access to the developer database. Visitors may 
have access only to the Internet, while only IT staff can access the entire passwords 
database. 
 
 
 
Accounting 
-
 
What services did each user access and for how long? Accounting records 
record the user's identification, network address, point of attachment and a unique 
session identifier

these statistics are tracked and added to 
 

is useful when time on the system is billed to individuals or 
departments
.
 
 
Features
 

 
Some of the features of TACACS+ are:
 
1.
 
Cisco proprietary protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between the Cisco device 
and Cisco ACS server.
 
2.
 
It uses TCP as transmiss
ion protocol.
 
3.
 
It uses TCP port number 49.
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using TACACS+ then all the AAA packets exchanged 
between them are encrypted.
 
5.
 
It separates AAA into distinct elements i.e
 
authentication, authorisation and accounting 
are separated.
 
6.
 
It provides greater granular control (than RADIUS) as the commands that are authorised 
to be used by the user can be specified.
 
7.
 
It provides accounting support but less extensive than RADIUS.

Aim: 
Study of various Authentication and access control services such as Radius, 
Tacacs and Tacacs+ 
 
 
Theory: 
 
NEED OF THE PROTOCOLS:
 
If a single administrator wants to access 100 routers and local database of the device is 
used for username and password (authentication) then the administrator have to make the 
same user account different times. Also, if he wants to keep different usernam
e and 
password for the devices then he have to manually change the authentication for the 

 
To ease this task to some extent, ACS (Access Control Server) is used. ACS provides a 
centralised management system in which t
he database of username and password are 
kept. Also, authorization (means what the user is authorised to do) can be configured. But 
for this we have to tell the router to refer to ACS for its decision on authentication and 
authorization. 
 
Two protocols are
 

 
1.
 
TACACS+ 
 
2.
 
R
ADIUS
 
RADIUS 

 
 
RADIUS, stands for 
Remote Authentication Dial In User 
S
ervice
, is a security protocol 
used in AAA framework to provide centralised authentication for users who want to gain 
access to the network. 
 
Features 

 
Some of the features of RADIUS are: 
 
1.
 
Open standard protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between any ven
dor 
device and Cisco ACS server. 
 
2.
 
It uses UDP as transmission protocol. 
 
3.
 
It uses UDP port number 1812 for authentication and authorisation and 1813 for 
accounting. 
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using RADIUS then only the passwords of AAA 
packets are enc
rypted. 
 
5.
 
No explicit command authorization can be implemented. 
 
6.
 
In RADIUS, authentication and authorization are coupled together. 
 
 
 
 
 
Working 

 
 
When other device want to access Network Access Server (NAS
-
client of RADIUS ), it 
will send access
-
request message to ACS server for the matching the credentials. In 
response to the access
-
request of the client, the ACS server will provide an 
accessaccept
 
message to the client if the credentials are valid and access
-
reject if the 
credentials do not match.

Advantage 

 
 
1.
 
As it is open standard, therefore it can be used between the other 
devices also. 
 
Disadvantage

As RADIUS uses UDP 
.

No explicit command authorization can be implemented.

Tacas:  
 
TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System) is an older authentication 
protocol common to UNIX networks that allows a remote access server to forward a user's 
log
i
n password to an authentication server to determine whether access can be allowed to 
a given system. TACACS is an encryption protocol and therefore less secure than the later 
TACACS+ and Remote Authentication Dial
-
In User Service protocols.  
 
 
 
 
 
Tacacs+: 
 
Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access
-
Control System Plus (TACACS+) are two common security protocols used to provide 
centralized access into networks. RADIUS was designed to authenticate and log remote
 
network users, while TACACS+ is most commonly used for administrator access to 
network devices like routers and switches. Both protocols provide centralized 
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for computers that 
connect and use 
a network service. 
 
Authentication 
-
 
Who is allowed to gain access to the network? Traditionally authorized users 
provide a username and password to verify their identity for both RADIUS and TACACS+
 
Authorization 
-
 
What services can a user access once they
 
are authenticated? It is unlikely 
that you want your finance people to have access to the developer database. Visitors may 
have access only to the Internet, while only IT staff can access the entire passwords 
database. 
 
 
 
Accounting 
-
 
What services did each user access and for how long? Accounting records 
record the user's identification, network address, point of attachment and a unique 
session identifier

these statistics are tracked and added to 
 

is useful when time on the system is billed to individuals or 
departments
.
 
 
Features
 

 
Some of the features of TACACS+ are:
 
1.
 
Cisco proprietary protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between the Cisco device 
and Cisco ACS server.
 
2.
 
It uses TCP as transmiss
ion protocol.
 
3.
 
It uses TCP port number 49.
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using TACACS+ then all the AAA packets exchanged 
between them are encrypted.
 
5.
 
It separates AAA into distinct elements i.e
 
authentication, authorisation and accounting 
are separated.
 
6.
 
It provides greater granular control (than RADIUS) as the commands that are authorised 
to be used by the user can be specified.
 
7.
 
It provides accounting support but less extensive than RADIUS.
 
Work
ing
 

 
The client of the TACACS+ is called Network Access Device (Nad) or Network Access 
Server (NAS).Network
 
Access Device will contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a 
username prompt through
 
CONTINUE
 
message . The user then enters a username and the 
Network Access Device again contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a password prompt 
(Continue message) displaying t
he password prompt to the user, the user enters a 
password, and the password is then sent to the TACACS+ server.
 
 
The server can respond with one of the following reply messages:
 

 
If the credentials entered are valid then the TACACS+ server will response wi
th an 
ACCEPT message.
 

 
If the credentials entered are not valid then the TACACS+ server will response with an 
REJECT message.
 

 
If the link between the TACACS+ server and NAS or TACACS+ server is not working 
properly then it will respond with an ERROR message
.
 

 
If TACACS+ authorization is required, the TACACS+ server is again contacted and it 
returns an ACCEPT or REJECT authorization response. If the ACCEPT message is 
returned, it contains attributes which are used to determine services that a user is 
allowed t
o do.
 
For accounting, the client will send a REQUEST message to the TACACS+ server for which 
the Server responds with RESPONSE message stating that record is received.
 
Advantage
 

 
1.
 
Provides greater granular control than RADIUS.TACACS+ allows a 
network 
administrator to define what commands a user may run.
 
2.
 
All the AAA packets are encrypted rather just passwords (in case of Radius).
 
3.
 
TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP. TCP guarantees communication between the 
client and server.
 
Disadvantage
 

 
1.
 
As it is 
Cisco proprietary, therefore it can be used between the Cisco devices only.
 
2.
 
Less extensive support for accounting than RADIUS.

Statement of Purpose
 

quit
. I never did, and I have abolished it. This adage is a composite of the life 
experiences I have assimilated in the academic domain. In the second year of my graduation, I scored 
poorly in one of the subjects which required an adept understanding of coding
. Hailing from an IT 
background, I was expected to perform well, but it turned out to be otherwise, and I was mocked for 
my inefficiency. You'll be criticized at some point in life, but the decision to fail or succeed depends on 

to work hard and prove my worth. With consistency, perseverance, and 
dedication, I transformed my destiny and today, owing to my strong background in the Information 
Technology sector, is the reason why I have decided to apply for admission in the Master o
f Computer 
Science program at your esteemed university. My hope and ambition from the Master program at 
G
eorge Mason 
University
 
are that it will thrust me into an all
-
new realm of intellectual acquisitions that 
will act as the wind 
beneath
 
my wings and let me so
ar to new heights as a passionate entrepreneur 
shortly.
 
 
As soon as I surpassed my schooling years, I secured my place in the Bachelor of Engineering 
Technology program. The four year
-
program trained me to put my analytical abilities, innovatively 
creative
 
vision and technical astuteness to good use. Given how 
-
inclined I was in computer systems 

me with a very holistic idea of the field. The USP of the un
dergrad course plunged me into study 
experiences that equally informed me about the complexities of programming and operating systems. 
For the most part, though, I enjoyed my undergraduate innings because it helped me refine my technical 
and analytical tra
its. While pursuing my undergraduate studies, I mastered research and development, 
expanding my intellectual capacity and improving my analytical and technical capabilities.
 
 
 
Right from the onset of the undergraduate program, I ensured that I dug my heels
 
deep in all subjects 

particularly invested in the study experiences. Second
-
year onwards, I was exposed to various 
information technology and computer scien


 
Data Structures & 

, along with many academic projects that allowed me to gather practical 
exp
erience. The courses served as a base for me and I enjoyed hustling with them. But I found my 
interest in the programming aspect bolstered when I commenced my business venture. Experimenting 
with a small project, I soon started getting many orders for webs
ite development. I realized that my 
technical acumen amalgamated with a creative approach can help me establish myself in this 

help of this project, the user 
can summarize long texts using three types of input options: Audio, 
Document, and Text. Based on the option selected, the application will convert the input into plain text, 
and then the summarizer will convert the text into a simplified output, which is t
he summary of the text. 
Depending on the option selected by the user, the summarized result will be displayed on the screen or 
converted into audio. Then the user will be able to hear the summarized output text.
 
 
My internship stint at Farsoft Infotech Pvt
