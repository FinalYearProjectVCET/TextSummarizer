NEED OF THE PROTOCOLS:
 
If a single administrator wants to access 100 routers and local database of the device is 
used for username and password (authentication) then the administrator have to make the 
same user account different times. Also, if he wants to keep different usernam
e and 
password for the devices then he have to manually change the authentication for the 

 
To ease this task to some extent, ACS (Access Control Server) is used. ACS provides a 
centralised management system in which t
he database of username and password are 
kept. Also, authorization (means what the user is authorised to do) can be configured. But 
for this we have to tell the router to refer to ACS for its decision on authentication and 
authorization. 
 
Two protocols are
 

 
1.
 
TACACS+ 
 
2.
 
R
ADIUS
 
RADIUS 

 
 
RADIUS, stands for 
Remote Authentication Dial In User 
S
ervice
, is a security protocol 
used in AAA framework to provide centralised authentication for users who want to gain 
access to the network. 
 
Features 

 
Some of the features of RADIUS are: 
 
1.
 
Open standard protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between any ven
dor 
device and Cisco ACS server. 
 
2.
 
It uses UDP as transmission protocol. 
 
3.
 
It uses UDP port number 1812 for authentication and authorisation and 1813 for 
accounting. 
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using RADIUS then only the passwords of AAA 
packets are enc
rypted. 
 
5.
 
No explicit command authorization can be implemented. 
 
6.
 
In RADIUS, authentication and authorization are coupled together. 
 
 
 
 
 
Working 

 
 
When other device want to access Network Access Server (NAS
-
client of RADIUS ), it 
will send access
-
request message to ACS server for the matching the credentials. In 
response to the access
-
request of the client, the ACS server will provide an 
accessaccept
 
message to the client if the credentials are valid and access
-
reject if the 
credentials do not match.

Advantage 

 
 
1.
 
As it is open standard, therefore it can be used between the other 
devices also.

Tacas:  
 
TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access Control System) is an older authentication 
protocol common to UNIX networks that allows a remote access server to forward a user's 
log
i
n password to an authentication server to determine whether access can be allowed to 
a given system. TACACS is an encryption protocol and therefore less secure than the later 
TACACS+ and Remote Authentication Dial
-
In User Service protocols.  
 
 
 
 
 
Tacacs+: 
 
Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access
-
Control System Plus (TACACS+) are two common security protocols used to provide 
centralized access into networks. RADIUS was designed to authenticate and log remote
 
network users, while TACACS+ is most commonly used for administrator access to 
network devices like routers and switches. Both protocols provide centralized 
Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) management for computers that 
connect and use 
a network service. 
 
Authentication 
-
 
Who is allowed to gain access to the network? Traditionally authorized users 
provide a username and password to verify their identity for both RADIUS and TACACS+
 
Authorization 
-
 
What services can a user access once they
 
are authenticated? It is unlikely 
that you want your finance people to have access to the developer database. Visitors may 
have access only to the Internet, while only IT staff can access the entire passwords 
database. 
 
 
 
Accounting 
-
 
What services did each user access and for how long? Accounting records 
record the user's identification, network address, point of attachment and a unique 
session identifier

these statistics are tracked and added to 
 

is useful when time on the system is billed to individuals or 
departments
.
 
 
Features
 

 
Some of the features of TACACS+ are:
 
1.
 
Cisco proprietary protocol for AAA framework i.e it can used between the Cisco device 
and Cisco ACS server.
 
2.
 
It uses TCP as transmiss
ion protocol.
 
3.
 
It uses TCP port number 49.
 
4.
 
If the device and ACS server is using TACACS+ then all the AAA packets exchanged 
between them are encrypted.
 
5.
 
It separates AAA into distinct elements i.e
 
authentication, authorisation and accounting 
are separated.
 
6.
 
It provides greater granular control (than RADIUS) as the commands that are authorised 
to be used by the user can be specified.
 
7.
 
It provides accounting support but less extensive than RADIUS.
 
Work
ing
 

 
The client of the TACACS+ is called Network Access Device (Nad) or Network Access 
Server (NAS).Network
 
Access Device will contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a 
username prompt through
 
CONTINUE
 
message . The user then enters a username and the 
Network Access Device again contact the TACACS+ server to obtain a password prompt 
(Continue message) displaying t
he password prompt to the user, the user enters a 
password, and the password is then sent to the TACACS+ server.
 
 
The server can respond with one of the following reply messages:
 

 
If the credentials entered are valid then the TACACS+ server will response wi
th an 
ACCEPT message.
 

 
If the credentials entered are not valid then the TACACS+ server will response with an 
REJECT message.
 

 
If the link between the TACACS+ server and NAS or TACACS+ server is not working 
properly then it will respond with an ERROR message
.
 

 
If TACACS+ authorization is required, the TACACS+ server is again contacted and it 
returns an ACCEPT or REJECT authorization response. If the ACCEPT message is 
returned, it contains attributes which are used to determine services that a user is 
allowed t
o do.
 
For accounting, the client will send a REQUEST message to the TACACS+ server for which 
the Server responds with RESPONSE message stating that record is received.
 
Advantage
 

 
1.
 
Provides greater granular control than RADIUS.TACACS+ allows a 
network 
administrator to define what commands a user may run.
 
2.
 
All the AAA packets are encrypted rather just passwords (in case of Radius).
 
3.
 
TACACS+ uses TCP instead of UDP. TCP guarantees communication between the 
client and server.
 
Disadvantage
 

 
1.
 
As it is 
Cisco proprietary, therefore it can be used between the Cisco devices only.
 
2.
 
Less extensive support for accounting than RADIUS.
