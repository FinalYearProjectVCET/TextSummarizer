      "Dollar gains on Greenspan speechThe dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.And Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan's speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"Worries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve's decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\n",

      "Yukos unit buyer faces loan claimThe owners of embattled Russian oil giant Yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $900m (Â£479m) loan.State-owned Rosneft bought the Yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by Russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against Yukos. Yukos' owner Menatep Group says it will ask Rosneft to repay a loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets. Rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. Legal experts said Rosneft's purchase of Yugansk would include such obligations. \"The pledged assets are with Rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of Yugansk assets,\" said Moscow-based US lawyer Jamie Firestone, who is not connected to the case. Menatep Group's managing director Tim Osborne told the Reuters news agency: \"If they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.\"Rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. But the company has said it intends to take action against Menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by Yugansk. Yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. The sale went ahead in December and Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.\n",

      "High fuel prices hit BA's profitsBritish Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.Reporting its results for the three months to 31 December 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of Â£75m ($141m) compared with Â£125m a year earlier. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by Â£106m or 47.3%. BA's profits were still better than market expectation of Â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.In October, it increased this from Â£6 to Â£10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from Â£2.50 to Â£4 a leg. Yet aviation analyst Mike Powell of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein says BA's estimated annual surcharge revenues - Â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra Â£250m. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to Â£1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. Looking ahead to its full year results to March 2005, BA warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"For the year to March 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" BA chairman Martin Broughton said. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Aviation analyst Nick Van den Brul of BNP Paribas described BA's latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"It is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"Our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" Mr Eddington said. \"For example, we have taken delivery of six Airbus A321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our Club World flat beds.\" BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\n",

      "Pernod takeover talk lifts DomecqShares in UK drinks and food firm Allied Domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by France's Pernod Ricard.Reports in the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times suggested that the French spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target. Allied Domecq shares in London rose 4% by 1200 GMT, while Pernod shares in Paris slipped 1.2%. Pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.Pernod's last major purchase was a third of US giant Seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. The other two-thirds of Seagram was bought by market leader Diageo. In terms of market value, Pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than Allied Domecq, which has a capitalisation of Â£5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). Last year Pernod tried to buy Glenmorangie, one of Scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm LVMH. Pernod is home to brands including Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, Havana Club rum and Jacob's Creek wine. Allied Domecq's big names include Malibu rum, Courvoisier brandy, Stolichnaya vodka and Ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream. The WSJ said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. Pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the Seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while Allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.\n",

      "dollar gains on greenspan speechthe dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the federal reserve head said the us trade deficit is set to stabilise.and alan greenspan highlighted the us government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. in late trading in new york, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on thursday. market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. on friday, federal reserve chairman mr greenspan's speech in london ahead of the meeting of g7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected us jobs data. \"i think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,\" said robert sinche, head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york. \"he's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"worries about the deficit concerns about china do, however, remain. china's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive. but calls for a shift in beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. the g7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy. in the meantime, the us federal reserve's decision on 2 february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with european rates. the half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the us's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. the white house will announce its budget on monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\n",
      "yukos unit buyer faces loan claimthe owners of embattled russian oil giant yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $900m (â£479m) loan.state-owned rosneft bought the yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against yukos. yukos' owner menatep group says it will ask rosneft to repay a loan that yugansk had secured on its assets. rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. legal experts said rosneft's purchase of yugansk would include such obligations. \"the pledged assets are with rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of yugansk assets,\" said moscow-based us lawyer jamie firestone, who is not connected to the case. menatep group's managing director tim osborne told the reuters news agency: \"if they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.\"rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. but the company has said it intends to take action against menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by yugansk. yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. the sale went ahead in december and yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.\n",
      "high fuel prices hit ba's profitsbritish airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.reporting its results for the three months to 31 december 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of â£75m ($141m) compared with â£125m a year earlier. rod eddington, ba's chief executive, said the results were \"respectable\" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by â£106m or 47.3%. ba's profits were still better than market expectation of â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.to help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, ba last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.in october, it increased this from â£6 to â£10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from â£2.50 to â£4 a leg. yet aviation analyst mike powell of dresdner kleinwort wasserstein says ba's estimated annual surcharge revenues - â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra â£250m. turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to â£1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. looking ahead to its full year results to march 2005, ba warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. however, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. \"for the year to march 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,\" ba chairman martin broughton said. ba had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.it also reported on friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in january. aviation analyst nick van den brul of bnp paribas described ba's latest quarterly results as \"pretty modest\". \"it is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,\" he said. since the 11 september 2001 attacks in the united states, ba has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. \"our focus remains on reducing controllable costs and debt whilst continuing to invest in our products,\" mr eddington said. \"for example, we have taken delivery of six airbus a321 aircraft and next month we will start further improvements to our club world flat beds.\" ba's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.\n",
      "pernod takeover talk lifts domecqshares in uk drinks and food firm allied domecq have risen on speculation that it could be the target of a takeover by france's pernod ricard.reports in the wall street journal and the financial times suggested that the french spirits firm is considering a bid, but has yet to contact its target. allied domecq shares in london rose 4% by 1200 gmt, while pernod shares in paris slipped 1.2%. pernod said it was seeking acquisitions but refused to comment on specifics.pernod's last major purchase was a third of us giant seagram in 2000, the move which propelled it into the global top three of drinks firms. the other two-thirds of seagram was bought by market leader diageo. in terms of market value, pernod - at 7.5bn euros ($9.7bn) - is about 9% smaller than allied domecq, which has a capitalisation of â£5.7bn ($10.7bn; 8.2bn euros). last year pernod tried to buy glenmorangie, one of scotland's premier whisky firms, but lost out to luxury goods firm lvmh. pernod is home to brands including chivas regal scotch whisky, havana club rum and jacob's creek wine. allied domecq's big names include malibu rum, courvoisier brandy, stolichnaya vodka and ballantine's whisky - as well as snack food chains such as dunkin' donuts and baskin-robbins ice cream. the wsj said that the two were ripe for consolidation, having each dealt with problematic parts of their portfolio. pernod has reduced the debt it took on to fund the seagram purchase to just 1.8bn euros, while allied has improved the performance of its fast-food chains.\n",
      "japan narrowly escapes recessionjapan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to september, figures show.revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. on an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. a common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.the government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. \"i maintain the view that japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,\" said economy minister heizo takenaka. but in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine. \"it's painting a picture of a recovery... much patchier than previously thought,\" said paul sheard, economist at lehman brothers in tokyo. improvements in the job market apparently have yet to feed through to domestic demand, with private consumption up just 0.2% in the third quarter.\n",
      "jobs growth still slow in the usthe us created fewer jobs than expected in january, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.according to labor department figures, us firms added only 146,000 jobs in january. the gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since september 2001. the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office. he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last november's presidential election - the first president to do so since herbert hoover. as a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. however, when adding december and january's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said rick egelton, deputy chief economist at bmo financial group. \"we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said ken mayland, president of clearview economics. \"that means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\n",

      "indonesians face fuel price riseindonesia's government has confirmed it is considering raising fuel prices by as much as 30%.millions of indonesians use kerosene for basic cooking, and prices have been heavily subsidised for years. president susilo bambang yudhoyono's government has said it wants to curb fuel subsidies and direct the money into aid programmes for the poor. but critics argue cutting subsidies will hurt the poorer families that his government says it wants to help. millions of people were left homeless in indonesia aceh's region following the earthquake and tsunami disaster in late december.indonesia pays subsidies to importers in order to stabilise domestic fuel prices, but higher oil prices have forced the government to spend more on holding prices down. it spent 59.2 trillion rupiah ($6.58bn; â£3.5bn) on fuel subsidies in 2004, a sum far in excess of its original projection of 14.5 trillion rupiah. since president yudhoyono's government came to power in october, it has indicated its intention of raising domestic fuel prices by cutting subsidies. \"the (january to march) quarter of this year is the best time for us to increase fuel prices,\" said sri mulyani indrawati, state minister for national development planning. \"we are still considering if a 30% hike is suitable at the moment. the sooner the better for the state budget.\" the bbc's correspondent in jakarta, rachel harvey, told world business report that there was likely to be a strong public reaction to any price rise. \"the big question is whether they go for one big, short, sharp shock and raise prices between 20% and 30% or whether they try to stagger it,\" she said. indonesia's previous government, led by president megawati sukarnoputri, also attempted to cut subsidies in 2003, but was forced to back down in the face of public protests.\n",
      "peugeot deal boosts mitsubishistruggling japanese car maker mitsubishi motors has struck a deal to supply french car maker peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (suv).the two firms signed a memorandum of understanding, and say they expect to seal a final agreement by spring 2005. the alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. the suvs will be built in japan using peugeot's diesel engines and sold mainly in the european market. falling sales have left mitsubishi motors with underused capacity, and the production deal with peugeot gives it a chance to utilise some of it.in january, mitsubishi motors issued its third profits warning in nine months, and cut its sales forecasts for the year to march 2005. its sales have slid 41% in the past year, catalysed by the revelation that the company had systematically been hiding records of faults and then secretly repairing vehicles. as a result, the japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. last month it said it was looking for a further 540bn yen ($5.2bn; â£2.77bn) in fresh financial backing, half of it from other companies in the mitsubishi group. us-german carmaker daimlerchrylser, a 30% shareholder in mitsubishi motors, decided in april 2004 not to pump in any more money. the deal with peugeot was celebrated by mitsubishi's newly-appointed chief executive takashi nishioka, who took over after three top bosses stood down last month to shoulder responsibility for the firm's troubles. mitsubishi motors has forecast a net loss of 472bn yen in its current financial year to march 2005. last month, it signed a production agreement with japanese rival nissan motor to supply it with 36,000 small cars for sale in japan. it has been making cars for nissan since 2003.\n",

      "air passengers win new eu rightsair passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.new eu rules set compensation at between 250 euros (â£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. the new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. the european commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the european low-fare airlines association (elaa) and the other from the international air transport association (iata), which has attacked the package as a \"bad piece of legislation\". previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.however, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.the eu decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. overbooking can often lead to 'bumping' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. when this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. in addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.however, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to \"extraordinary circumstances\". airlines fear that \"extraordinary circumstances\" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. all eu-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the eu will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on thursday. low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. \"it's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" ryanair deputy chief executive michael cawley told radio 4's today programme.the european regions airline association (eraa) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. andy clarke, eraa director of air transport, said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.ec spokeswoman marja quillinan-meiland conceded there were \"grey areas\" but said \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out\". in cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. new technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. the eraa's mr clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. \"we reckon it's going to cost european air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over â£1bn a year loaded onto european passengers,\" mr clarke said. \"that's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"on wednesday, jacques barrot, vice president of the european commission and also commissioner for transport, said that the changes were necessary. \"the boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers' right.\" \"this is a concrete example of how the union benefits people's daily lives,\" he added. the ec has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.\n",
      "china keeps tight rein on creditchina's efforts to stop the economy from overheating by clamping down on credit will continue into 2005, state media report.the curbs were introduced earlier this year to ward off the risk that rapid expansion might lead to soaring prices. there were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. growth in china remains at a breakneck 9.1%, and corporate investment is growing at more than 25% a year. the breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. rapid tooling-up of china's manufacturing sector means a massive demand for energy - one of the factors which has kept world oil prices sky-high for most of this year. in theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a \"hard landing\" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. a low exchange rate - china's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means chinese exports are cheap on world markets. china has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg. to some extent, the credit controls do seem to be taking effect. industrial output grew 15.7% in the year to october, down from 23% in february, and inflation slowed to 4.3% - although retail sales are still booming.\n",

      "call centre users 'lose patience'customers trying to get through to call centres are getting impatient and quicker to hang up, a survey suggests.once past the welcome message, callers on average hang up after just 65 seconds of listening to canned music. the drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. \"customers are getting used to the idea of an 'always available' society,\" says cara diemont of it firm dimension data, which commissioned the survey. however, call centres also saw a sharp increase of customers simply abandoning calls, she says, from just over 5% in 2003 to a record 13.3% during last year. when automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. one possible reason for the lack in patience, ms diemont says, is the fact that more customers are calling 'on the move' using their mobile phones.the surge in customers trying to get through to call centres is also a reflection of the centres' growing range of tasks. \"once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts,\" ms diemont says. problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found.in what dimension data calls an \"alarming development\", the average induction time for a call centre worker fell last year from 36 to just 21 days, leaving \"agents not equipped to deal with customers\". this, ms diemont warns, is \"scary\" and not good for the bottom line either. poor training frustrates both call centre workers and customers. as a result, call centres have a high \"churn rate\", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. resolution rates - the number of calls where a customer's query is resolved to mutual satisfaction - are running at just 50%. when the query is passed on to a second or third person - a specialist or manager - rates rise to about 70%, but that is still well below the industry target of an 85% resolution rate.suggestions that \"outsourcing\" - relocating call centres to low-cost countries like india or south africa - is to blame are wrong, ms diemont says.there are \"no big differences in wait time and call resolution\" between call centres based in europe or north america and those in developing countries around the world. \"you can make call centres perform anywhere if you have good management and the right processes in place,\" she says. however, companies that decide to \"offshore\" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. only 42% of them say that saving money is the main consideration when closing domestic call centre operations. half of them argue that workers in other countries offer better skills for the money. but not everybody believes that outsourcing and offshoring are the solution. nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. they give three key reasons for not making the move:- call centre operations are part of their business \"core function\", - they are worried about the risk of going abroad, - they fear that they will damage their brand if they join the offshoring drive. the survey was conducted by sunovate on behalf of dimension data, and is based on in-depth questionnaires of 166 call centres in 24 countries and five continents. what are your experiences with call centres? are you happy to listen to vivaldi or greensleeves, or do you want an immediate response? and if you work in a call centre: did your training prepare you for your job?\n",
      "rank 'set to sell off film unit'leisure group rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business, reports claim.rank, formerly famous for the carry on series, will expose the shake-up at the announcement of its results on friday, the sunday telegraph reported. advisors goldman sachs are understood to have valued its demerged deluxe film unit at â£300m, the report added. speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since rank announced a study into a possible demerger in september. since mike smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the odeon cinema chain and the pinewood studios. the move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, hard rock and deluxe films, which provides technical services to hollywood studios.rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its hard rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. it also owns deluxe media, which makes and distributes dvds and videos. however, that business is seen as less successful. last year it made profits of â£21.5m on a turnover of â£392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to dvds from vhs video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. a spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on friday. analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to â£170m from â£194m last year. formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading uk film producer and cinema owner for many years. it has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the uk - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. it now owns 34 grosvenor casinos, the mecca bingo chain and more than 100 hard rock cafes in 38 countries.\n",

      "japan economy slides to recessionthe japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters. the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. on wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips japan into recession.a previous estimate of 0.1% growth between july and september was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.figures released by the government's cabinet office showed that gdp, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. however, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. \"the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,\" said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka. gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. \"the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone,\" mr takenaka stressed.ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japan's largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. however, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. \"the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn't be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,\" said naoki iizuka, senior economist at the dai-ichi life research institute. japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.\n",

      "parmalat to return to stockmarketparmalat, the italian dairy company which went bust after an accounting scandal, hopes to be back on the italian stock exchange in july.the firm gained protection from creditors in 2003 after revealing debts of 14bn euros ($18.34bn; â£9.6bn). this was eight times higher than it had previously stated. in a statement issued on wednesday night, parmalat finanziaria detailed administrators' latest plans for re-listing the shares of the group.as part of the re-listing on the italian stock exchange, creditors' debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros. the company's creditors will be asked to vote on the plan later this year. the plan is likely to give creditors of parmalat finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed. this is lower than the 11.3% creditors previously hoped to receive. creditors of parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%.several former top parmalat executives are under investigation for the fraud scandal. lawmakers said on wednesday night enrico bondi, the turnaround specialist appointed by the italian government as parmalat's chief executive, spoke positively about the company during a closed-door hearing of the chamber of deputies industry commission. \"bondi supplied us with elements of positive results on the industrial positions and on the history of debt which will find a point of solution through the parmalat group's quotation on the market in july,\" italian news agency apcom quoted several lawmakers as saying in a statement.\n",
      "bmw cash to fuel mini productionless than four years after the new mini was launched, german car maker bmw has announced â£100m of new investment.some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. the rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday's announcement, bmw had invested some â£280m in mini production.since its launch during summer 2001, the new mini has gone from strength to strength.last year, almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. \"our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away,\" said norbert reithofer, a member of the bmw management board. initially, bmw said it would produce 100,000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. \"the risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle,\" said brad wernle, from automotive news europe.the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched, the cheapest mini cost just more than â£10,000. these days, buyers will have to fork out almost â£11,500 to own a new mini one, or even more for the cooper s which costs up to â£17,730. the mini convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least â£8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from â£12,556, according to the-car buying website parker's. the consumers' association which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se.the cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 minis, is increasingly being put to good use.there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw's mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for â£10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999, when bmw still owned rover, the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 mini-workers. the mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 rover cars. last year, mg rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed, mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.\n",
      "bad weather hits nestle salesa combination of bad weather, rising raw material costs and the sluggish european economy has hit sales at swiss food and drink giant nestle.revenue dipped 1.4% to 86.7bn swiss francs ($74.6bn; â£39.1bn) in 2004 as sales of ice cream and mineral water were dampened by the wet summer. however, nestle's profits margins were helped by a strong performance in the americas and china. nestle is to raise its dividend by 11% after paying back some of its debt.nestle said that the strength of the swiss franc against the us dollar, the disposal of businesses and challenging trading conditions in europe all dented sales. a poor summer across the continent - in contrast to the prolonged heat wave in 2003 - \"severely affected\" demand for ice cream. sales of bottled water also fell, although chocolate, coffee, frozen goods and petcare products performed better.elsewhere, nestle said it had enjoyed an \"exceptional\" year in north america, outperforming the market in terms of sales growth. nestle added that it had performed strongly in africa and asia despite the impact of high oil prices and political instability. nestle's total earnings before interest remained broadly flat over the past year, despite the company managing to boost profit margins. as well as increasing its dividend, nestle plans to buy back shares worth 1bn swiss francs ($861m; â£451m). looking forward, nestle forecasts organic earnings growth of about 5% in 2005, although it warned that trading would remain just as competitive.uncertainty remains over the future of perrier, the iconic french mineral water owned by nestle. perrier has been locked in a long-standing dispute with unions about productivity levels at the business, which has lead nestle to consider selling the firm. \"the option of selling is perrier is still on the table,\" chief executive peter brabeck-letmathe confirmed on thursday.\n",
      "fiat mulls ferrari market listingferrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of fiat's carmaking operations, the financial times has reported.it said fiat was set to restructure its business after reaching a $2bn (1.53bn euros; â£1.05bn) settlement with gm about fiat's ownership. steps being considered include listing ferrari and bringing maserati and alfa romeo closer together, it said. despite strong sales of alfa romeo, fiat's car business is making a loss.under the proposals - which the paper said could be announced within days - the iconic sportscar maker could be listed separately on the market. fiat owns a 56% stake in ferrari -best known for its dominant formula one motor racing team - having first bought into the business in 1969. it considered floating ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to italian bank mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). that sale valued ferrari - which owns the maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. the price tag would change if maserati was stripped out. the financial times said fiat may transfer maserati within its wholly- owned alfa romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies. such a move would help alfa romeo and maserati to share marketing, distribution and research & development costs. maserati and ferrari sell about 10,000 cars between them and both companies broke even in 2003.fiat, italy's largest private sector employer, did not comment on the reported changes. fiat recently negotiated an end to its alliance with general motors. the us firm agreed to pay $2bn to exit an agreement under which it could have been liable to buy fiat outright. analysts said the reported restructuring was evidence of the greater flexibility which fiat now had to develop the business.\n",
      "italy to get economic action planitalian prime minister silvio berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on thursday night in rome.he will present an \"action plan for the development of italy\" in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. mr berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (r&d) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. the prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 gmt.the government has been accused of underfunding r&d, making it harder for italy to compete with other european nations and leading to a \"brain-drain\" of the country's brightest talents. analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. as a result, they say, italy's corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. at the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering italy's entrepreneurial spirit.the government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of italy's 60 million population. according to il sole 24 ore, italy's business newspaper, the government will focus on \"opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system\".mr berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; â£4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. he has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility enel. critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make italy's problems worse. limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.the country has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years. growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. at the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing italy's economy to a juddering halt. consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of italy's economy.\n",

      "fao warns on impact of subsidiesbillions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the un's food & agriculture organisation has warned.trade barriers and subsidies \"severely\" distort the market, the fao report on the \"state of agricultural commodity markets 2004\" said. as a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. the most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. the fao report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.the fao has urged the world trade organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market. it also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. it recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.according to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the european union and the us, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. in fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (â£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. the market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the fao said. the first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. for 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. these countries are mainly situated in sub-saharan africa, latin america and the caribbean.\n",
      "india seeks to boost constructionindia has cleared a proposal allowing up to 100% foreign direct investment in its construction sector.kamal nath, commerce and industry minister, announced the decision in delhi on thursday following a cabinet meeting. analysts say improving india's infrastructure will boost foreign investment in other sectors too. the indian government's decision has spread good cheer in the construction sector, according to some indian firms.a spokesman for dlf builders, dr vancheshwar, told the bbc this will mean \"better offerings\" for consumers as well as builders. he said the firm will benefit from world class \"strategic partnerships, design expertise and technology, while consumers will have better choice.\"the government proposal states that foreign investment of up to 100% will be allowed on the 'automatic route' in the construction sector, on projects including housing, hotels, resorts, hospitals and educational establishments. the automatic route means that construction companies need only get one set of official approvals and do not need to gain clearance from the foreign investment promotion board, which can be bureaucratic. the government hopes its new policy will create employment for construction workers, and benefit steel and brick-making industries.mr nath also announced plans to allow foreign investors to develop a smaller area of any land they acquired. \"foreign investors can enter any construction development area, be it to build resorts, townships or commercial premises but they will have to construct at least 50,000 square meters (538,000 square feet) within a specific timeframe,\" said mr nath, without specifying the timeframe. previously foreign investors had to develop a much larger area, discouraging some from entering the indian market. this measure is designed to discourage foreign investors from buying and selling land speculatively, without developing it. anshuman magazine, managing director, of cb richard ellis - an international real estate company - told the bbc this was \"a big positive step.\"however, chittabrata majumdar, general secretary of the centre of indian trade unions (citu), said allowing fdi in the country is compromising india's own \"self reliance\". he said, \"no country can develop on the basis of foreign investment alone.\" mr majumdar also said an assessment should be made as to whether foreign investment is indeed beneficial to the country - in terms of employment and money generated - or just another way of international companies filling their deep pockets.\n",
      "boeing unveils new 777 aircraftus aircraft firm boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.the 777-200lr will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as london and sydney. boeing, in contrast to european rival airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. airbus, which overtook boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between boeing and airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.it is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200lr and its much-anticipated 787 dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. the 777-200lr, which had its launch delayed by the 11 september attacks in the us, is the fifth variation of boeing's twin-aisle 777 plane. the company offically \"rolled-out\" the new 777 in seattle at 2200 gmt. better fuel efficiency from engines made by ge and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.\"boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,\" said david learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international. but the 777-200lr \"is a niche player\", mr learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. mr learmount pointed out that the 777-200lr has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.for airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. from there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. it has been producing a rival to boeing's 777 line for more than a year. \"airbus is now where boeing was a few years ago\" with its product range, said flight international's mr learmount.both boeing and airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200lr planes over the next 20 years. it already has orders from pakistan international airlines and eva of taiwan. these orders should help underpin the company's profits. boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a us air force 767 tanker contract. net profit was $186m (â£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.\n",

      "yukos accused of lying to courtrussian oil firm yukos lied to a us court in an attempt to stop the russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard.the unit, yugansk, was sold to pay off a $27.5bn (â£14.5bn) back tax bill. yukos argued that since it had a us subsidiary and local bank accounts, the us court could declare it bankrupt and stop the auction of yugansk. but deutsche bank - itself a target of a yukos lawsuit - said documents had been backdated to strengthen the case.deutsche bank's evidence came on the first day of a two-day hearing in houston. its lawyer, hugh ray, told the court that yukos had claimed it had transferred $27m into two texas bank accounts opened by its new us subsidiary. by doing so, he said, the firm had intended to reinforce its us presence - and thus its chances of getting its case heard in us courts. but he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 december, and then backdated.yukos chief financial officer bruce misamore, who had moved to the us in early december to set up yukos usa, acknowledged the point. he said the discrepancy was only in the paperwork, but that money had indeed been transferred on 14 december. even so, he told the court that only $480,000 had been in the accounts that day, with the rest arriving a day later.deutsche bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by yukos. it had agreed to loan to an arm of russian state gas firm gazprom the money to bid for yuganskneftegaz, as the yukos unit is formally known. the sale went ahead, despite an order from the us bankruptcy court ordered that it should be stopped. in the end, the auction was won by an unknown shell company for $9.4bn - much less than most assessments of its value - before ending up in the hands of state-controlled oil firm rosneft. rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with gazprom, bringing a large chunk of russia's very profitable oil business back under state control.yukos maintains that it filed for bankruptcy in the us because it feared it would not be able to do so in russia. it also said that in the event of going bust, it could offer the chance of restructuring. \"it gives us a kind of life after death alternative,\" said yukos chief executive steven theede. yukos is currently suing four companies - gazprom, its unit gazpromneft, rosneft and the shell company which won the bidding - for their part in yugansk's disposal. it has also threatened to sue the russian government for $28bn. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies, while moscow officials have dismissed yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky, once russia's richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.\n",

      "europe blames us over weak dollareuropean leaders have openly blamed the us for the sharp rise in the value of the euro.us officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words. meeting in brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports. the dollar is within touching distance of an all-time low reached earlier in november. at 0619 gmt on tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in tokyo. it rallied briefly on monday amid signs that oil prices are easing.but analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary. the european ministers' comments, said junya tanase of jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo, were \"generally too weak to produce a market reaction\".still, by the standards of diplomacy the european ministers were forthright. nicolas sarkozy of france said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit europe's economies by eating into their exports. \"we are concerned about these developments, which are destabilising, and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our american friends,\" he said. the comments come a day after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was \"in america's interest\".but that was not enough for mr sarkozy.\"if the americans were to change their policy, it's up to them to say so,\" he said. and the european union's monetary affairs commissioner, made it clear that action was necessary. \"i fully welcome the words of mr snow,\" said joaquin almunia, \"but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction. \"if the imbalances in the us economy are not adjusted in the future, the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks.\" economists point out that whatever europe says, in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to president george w bush's administration. not only does it boost us exports, but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund. on the other hand, slower european exports would mean slower eu growth - potentially reducing the demand for us goods.\n",

      "bank opts to leave rates on holdthe bank of england has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.the bank's monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. but some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. interest rates rose five times between november 2003 and august 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. bank of england governor mervyn king has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the mpc is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. economists see next week's inflation report from the mpc as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the mpc that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in december - its highest level in six months. data on wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since may last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.and recent house surveys from the halifax and nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. philip shaw, chief economist at investec securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. \"the economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, \" he said. \"growth appears stronger and the mpc may become more concerned about inflation trends.\" howard archer, economist at global insight said the mpc \"may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside\".business groups welcomed the mpc's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. the british chambers of commerce (bcc) said it was \"concerned by the clamour in some quarters\" for early interest rate increases. \"we believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,\" said david frost, bcc director general. \"manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures.\" ian mccafferty, chief economist at the cbi, said the mpc faced an \"interesting\" challenge. \"consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,\" he said. \"however, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.\"\n",

      "salary scandal in camerooncameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it 1bn cfa francs ($2m; â£1m) a month.about 500 officials are accused of either awarding themselves extra money or claiming salaries for \"non-existent\" workers. prime minister ephraim inoni, who vowed to tackle corruption when he came to office last year, said those found guilty would face tough punishments. the scam is believed to have begun in 1994.the prime minister's office said the alleged fraud was uncovered during an investigation into the payroll at the ministry. in certain cases, staff are said to have lied about their rank and delayed their retirement in order to boost their earnings. the prime minister's office said auditors had found \"irregularities in the career structure of certain civil servants\". it added that the staff in question \"appear to have received unearned salaries, boosting the payroll\".fidelis nanga, a journalist based in the cameroon capital yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed. \"the prime minister has given instructions for exemplary penalties to be meted out against the accused and their accomplices if found guilty,\" he told the bbc's network africa programme.mr inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in december after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the country's public finances. in one initiative designed to improve efficiency, civil servants who arrived late for work were locked out of their offices. the government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries. in a report compiled by anti-corruption body transparency international in 2003, graft was said to be \"pervasive\" in cameroon.\n",
      "us adds more jobs than expectedthe us economy added 337,000 jobs in october - a seven-month high and far more than wall street expectations.in a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected president george w bush, the labor department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. jobs were created in every sector of the us economy except manufacturing. while the separate unemployment rate went up to 5.5% from 5.4% in september, this was because more people were now actively seeking work.the 337,000 new jobs added to us payrolls in october was twice the 169,000 figure that wall street economists had forecast. in addition, the labor department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in september instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in august instead of 128,000. the better than expected jobs data had an immediate upward effect on stocks in new york, with the main dow jones index gaining 45.4 points to 10,360 by late morning trading. \"it looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year,\" said economist gary thayer of ag edwards & sons.other analysts said the upbeat jobs data made it more likely that the us federal reserve would increase interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 2% when it meets next week. \"it should empower the fed to clearly do something,\" said robert macintosh, chief economist with eaton vance management in boston. kathleen utgoff, commissioner of the bureau of labor, said many of the 71,000 new construction jobs added in october were involved in rebuilding and clean-up work in florida, and neighbouring deep south states, following four hurricanes in august and september. the dollar rose temporarily on the job creation news before falling back to a new record low against the euro, as investors returned their attention to other economic factors, such as the us's record trade deficit. there is also speculation that president bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.\n",
      "feta cheese battle reaches courta row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice.the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name. the commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne. but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside greece.the commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave \"protected designation of origin\" status to feta cheese made in greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.from 2007 onwards, greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products. the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. \"in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,\" hans arne kristiansen, a spokesman for the danish dairy board, told the bbc. denmark is europe's second largest producer of feta after greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to greece. it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie. \"it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,\" mr kristiansen said. \"that is just one of the costs.\"the case will also have a major impact on britain's sole feta producer, yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses.judy bell, the company's founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. \"if we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,\" she said. \"we have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eyes - it's very clear from the label that it's yorkshire feta.\" the original decision was a victory for greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years. feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine. greece makes 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption. the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.\n",
      "ukraine revisits state sell-offsukraine is preparing what could be a wholesale review of the privatisation of thousands of businesses by the previous administration.the new president, viktor yushchenko, has said a \"limited\" list of companies is being drawn up. but on wednesday prime minister yulia tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. the government says many privatised firms were sold to allies of the last administration at rock-bottom prices. more than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled.ms tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed. \"we will return to the state that which was illegally put into private hands.\"a day earlier, mr yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. the list \"will be limited and final, and will not be extended after its completion\", he said. an open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in ukraine, said stuart hensel of the economist intelligence unit. but the government seemed keen not to make the review look like the kind of wholesale renationalisation which many fear in russia, mr hensel said. as a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. \"they're aware of the need not to scare investors, and to be careful of internal divides within ukraine,\" he said. \"they don't want to be seen to be transferring assets from one set of oligarchs to a new set.\" foreign investment in ukraine, at about $40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-soviet states.mr yushchenko became president after two elections in december, the first of which was annulled amid allegations of voting irregularities and massive street protests.his opponent, viktor yanukovich, still has huge support in the country's eastern industrial heartland. mr yushchenko's administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-president leonid kuchma, of corruption. the privatisation review's number one target is a steel mill sold to a consortium which included viktor pinchuk, mr kuchma's son-in-law, for $800m (â£424m) despite higher bids from several foreign groups. the mill, krivorizhstal, is one of the world's most profitable. \"we say krivorizhstal was stolen, and at any cost we will return it to the state,\" mr yushchenko told an investors' conference in kiev.one of the jilted bidders, netherlands-based group lnm, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market.\"if the original privatisation is annulled and a new tender issued, then we would look at it with great interest,\" a spokesman told bbc news. a resale of krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the economist intelligence unit's mr hensel. but he warned that the government could decide to take the easy route of revaluing the company and charging the existing owners the revised price rather than undertaking a fresh sale. \"that way, mr yushchenko can go to the public and say he has forced the oligarchs to play by the rules,\" he told bbc news.\n",

      "why few targets are better than manythe economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world's leading economy by 2010.but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn't become a global economic laggard. they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia, india and china, as well as with the economic might of the united states. that's why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on wednesday, by the former dutch prime minister wim kok. mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. his conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.lisbon risks becoming a \"synonym for missed objectives and failed promises\", his report said. \"the status quo is not an option.\"at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built, it said. the report comes at a time when europe's competitive position is waning. the eu's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe, productivity lags behind that of the us. but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far. that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.as mr kok's report noted: \"the ink had scarcely dried on the [lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded.\" \"the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit.\"the circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000. neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so-called \"knowledge-based economy\". \"the [lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,\" said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council, a brussels-based citizen action group. \"what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. you find trade unions fighting change. but also the employers' associations. \"even though they tell you they're in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.\"but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago. targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the wim report. economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.\"lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,\" the kok report said. \"everybody is responsible and thus no one.\" that's why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they're taking towards meeting the targets, effectively \"naming, shaming and faming\". \"rhetoric and delivery don't necessarily go hand in hand,\" mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. \"we don't have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.\"on one point mr kok was very clear: the european union should not try to emulate the us economy. the european economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. in that sense, the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. \"it's very ambitious,\" said john palmer, political director at the european policy centre, a brussels-based think-tank. \"this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. it's going to require quite new and innovative policies.\" but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality. for example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. but it doesn't say how companies should be convinced to do this. it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission, jose manuel barroso, to adopt mr kok's recommendations and press them on eu governments. mr barroso has said that the eu's competitiveness will be his top priority. he expects his five-year term in office to be judged on europe's success in meeting the

      "alfa romeos 'to get gm engines'fiat is to stop making six-cylinder petrol engines for its sporty alfa romeo subsidiary, unions at the italian carmaker have said.the unions claim fiat is to close the fiat powertrain plant at arese near milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from general motors. fiat has yet to comment on the matter, but the unions say the new engines will be made by gm in australia. the news comes a week after gm pulled out of an agreement to buy fiat. gm had to pay former partner fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian carmaker outright. fiat and gm also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing, but did agree to continue buying each other's engines.\"powertrain told us today that alfa romeo engines will no longer be made in arese,\" said union leader vincenzo lilliu, as reported by the reuters news agency. \"the assembly line will be dismantled and the six-cylinder alfa romeo motor will be replaced with an engine gm produces in australia.\" reuters also said that mr lilliu and other union bosses shouted insults at fiat chairman luca di montezemolo, following a meeting on tuesday regarding the future of the arese plant. the unions said the end of engine production at the facility would mean the loss of 800 jobs. all alfa romeo models can be bought with a six-cylinder engine - the 147, 156, 156 sportwagon, 166, gtv, gt and spider.\n",
      "saab to build cadillacs in swedengeneral motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized cadillac bls at its loss-making saab factory in sweden.the car, unveiled at the geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market. it will not be sold in the us, said gm europe president carl-peter forster. as part of its efforts to make the us marque appeal to european drivers, the car will be the first cadillac with a diesel engine.gm's announcement should go some way to allay fears of the saab factory's closure. the factory in trollhaettan has been at the centre of rumours about gm's planned severe cutbacks in its troubled european operations. but the group's new commitment to the swedish factory may not be welcomed by the group's opel workers in ruesselsheim, germany. they may now have to face a larger proportion of gm's cuts.neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in sweden, since it reflects saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative european luxury car market. for years, saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with bmw, mercedes and jaguar. the segment's leaders do not agree.gm's plans to build the american marque in sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for european drivers. in the us, it has long been established as an upmarket brand - even the presidential limousine carries the badge. yet it could prove tough for cadillac to steal market share from the majors in europe. other luxury car makers, most notably the toyota subsidiary lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the us without managing to make significant inroads in europe. there, german marques mercedes benz and bmw have retained their stranglehold on the luxury market.bringing cadillac production to sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. that is about half of what major car makers consider sufficient numbers for profitable operations, and saab is losing money fast - albeit with losses halved in 2004 to $200m (â£104m; 151m euros) from $500m the previous year. beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its european operations, gm is reducing expenditure by building saabs, opels - badged as vauxhalls in the uk - and now cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. another way to further reduce saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of saabs to the us, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket european car. doing so would remove the exposure to the weak us dollar, which is making saabs more expensive to us consumers. but not everyone in the industry agree that it would be the best way forward. \"we know that in five years the us dollar will be stronger than it is today,\" the chief executive of a leading european car maker told bbc news. the current trend towards us production was \"stupid\", he said.in a separate announcement, gm unveiled a new scheme to allow european consumers the chance to test drive its opel and vauxhall models. it is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. it follows a similar initiative by gm in the us. gm said it wanted to change \"customers' perceptions\" about opel and vauxhall cars, showing them that the quality had improved in recent years.\n",

      "yukos sues four firms for $20bnrussian oil firm yukos has sued four companies for their role in last year's forced state auction of its key oil production unit yuganskneftegas.yukos is claiming more than $20bn (â£11bn) in damages after yugansk was sold in december to settle back taxes. the four companies named in the law suit are gas giant gazprom, its unit gazpromneft, investment company baikal, and state oil firm rosneft. yukos submitted the suit in houston, where it filed for bankruptcy. as well as suing for damages, yukos has asked the us court to send its tax dispute with the russian government to an international arbitrator. it also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.the clash between yukos and the kremlin came to a head last year when yukos was hit with a bill of more than $27bn in back taxes and unpaid fines. to settle the bill, russia forced yukos to sell off yuganskneftegas.yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the us in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. it also has vowed to use all legal means at its disposal to go after any firm that tries to buy or take control of its assets. earlier this month it sued the russian government for $28.3bn. analysts have questioned whether a us court has any jurisdiction over russian companies, while moscow officials have dismissed yukos' legal wrangling as meaningless. in houston, bankruptcy judge letitia clark will start a two-day hearing on 16 february to hear arguments on whether a us court is the proper forum for the case.the threat of legal action from yukos and its bankruptcy filing in houston did have an effect on last year's auction, however. concerned that it would be caught up in a court battle, gazprom and gazpromneft withdrew from the auction, and yuganskneftegas was sold to little-known investment firm baikal finance group. a few days later, baikal gave control of the company to state-run oil group rosneft for $9.3bn. rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with gazprom, bringing a large chunk of russia's very profitable oil business back under state control. yukos claims that the rights of its shareholders have been ignored and that is has been punished for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky, once russia's richest man, is in prison, having been charged with fraud and tax evasion and repeatedly denied bail.\n",

      "india and russia in energy talksindia and russia are to work together in a series of energy deals, part of a pact which could see india invest up to $20bn in oil and gas projects.on the agenda are oil and gas extraction as well as transportation deals, to be led by russian energy giant gazprom and india's ongc. the indian firm is also expected to hold talks on tuesday about buying a stake in assets once owned by yukos. it is reported to be keen on buying a 15% stake in oil unit yuganskneftegas. the former yukos subsidiary was controversially sold off last year and eventually acquired by state-owned energy giant rosneft.russian media reported that india and russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on tuesday during a meeting between oil and natural gas corporation chairman subir raha, gazprom chairman aleksey miller and india's petroleum minister mani shankar aiyar.the agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in russia, india and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from russia to india and other countries across asia. ongc could invest in gas and oil fields in sakhalin, in the far east of russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern siberia and the caspian sea.india is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.ongc's mr raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year. \"at current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good,\" he told reuters. \"what we are saying is - gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money. \"the investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so.\"russian news agencies reported that india's petroleum minister mr aiyar and russian energy minister viktor khristenko would discuss the future of yugansk at a meeting on tuesday. ongc's mr raha declined to be drawn on his firm's reported interest in the company. however, he stressed that ongc was not interested in a 'loan-for-oil deal' in connection to yugansk, similar to that concluded recently between rosneft and china's national petroleum corporation. \"china's problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. we do not. we would like long-term security through equity participation.\" it is thought that any decision over yugansk will be delayed until a us court has decided whether to grant yukos bankruptcy protection. yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of yugansk, auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill. it has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary.\n",
      "weak data buffets french economya batch of downbeat government data has cast doubt over the french economy's future prospects.official figures showed on friday that unemployment was unchanged at 9.9% last month, while consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in october. at the same time, finance minister nicolas sarkozy warned that high oil prices posed a threat to french growth. \"[oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,\" he said. world oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.analysts said french companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. \"[the unemployment figures] show the main problem of the french economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,\" said marc touati, an economist at natexis banques populaires. \"politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late.\" obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in france than in many other european economies. many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. the french statistics agency, insee, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. that is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.\n",
      "business fears over sluggish eu economyas european leaders gather in rome on friday to sign the new eu constitution, many companies will be focusing on matters much closer to home - namely how to stay in business.lille is a popular tourist destination for britons who want a taste of france at the weekend. but how many tourists look at the impressively grand victorian chambre de commerce, which stands beside the opera house, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern english towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? like northern england and industrial scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990. beck-crespel is a specialist steel firm in armentieres, about 20 miles from lille. the company has not laid off a worker since 1945. it specialises in making bolts and fixings for power stations and the oil industry, but not many of those are being built in europe these days.director hugues charbonnier says he is under pressure because factories in the far east are able to make some of his output more cheaply, while his key markets are now in china and india. \"in our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged european union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200,\" he says. it isn't just globalisation that is hurting; the law in france means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. but at least there is still a steel industry. coal has now totally vanished and textiles are struggling. new business has been attracted, but not enough to make up the difference.that is one reason why people here are not great fans of the eu, says frederic sawicki, a politics lecturer at the university of lille.\"in the region today the unemployment rate is 12%, in some areas it is 15%. they don't see what europe is doing for them, so there is a kind of euro scepticism, especially in the working classes,\" he says. which is strange because lille is at the crossroads of europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. the euro was designed to increase trade within the eurozone, but the biggest increase in trade has been with the rest of the world. much of that trade passes through the world's largest port, rotterdam, in holland, home to specialist crane maker huisman itrec. its cranes help build oil rigs and lifted the sunken russian submarine kursk from the sea bed, but huisman itrec is now setting up a factory in china, where costs are cheaper and its main customers are closer.boss henk addink blames the low growth rate in europe for the lack of orders closer to home. \"in the us growth is something like 6%, in china they are estimating 15%, and in the eu it is more or less 1%,\" he says. mr addink blames the euro for stifling demand. he much preferred the old currencies of europe, which moved in relation to each country's economic performance. in germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. in britain that would be a bad year; in germany it is one of the best in recent years. with germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem. if germany doesn't once again become the powerhouse of europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. however, at one factory near the dutch border things are changing.the siemens plant at boscholt makes cordless phones and employs 2,000 staff. staff have started working an extra four hours a week for no extra pay, after siemens threatened to take the factory and their jobs to hungary. factory manager herbert stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity \"by nearly 30%\". but germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such hungary or china. the government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says helmut schneider, director of the institute for the study of labour at bonn university. \"labour is too costly in germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. if we could solve that problem we could cut unemployment by half,\" he says. the eu set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.\n",

      "qwest may spark mci bidding warus phone company qwest has said it will table a new offer for mci after losing out to larger rival verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.mci accepted a $6.75bn (â£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant verizon on monday, rejecting a higher offer from qwest. qwest chairman richard notebaert sent a letter to mci's board on thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining verizon's bid. formerly known as worldcom, mci is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. snapping up mci would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. shares of mci were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of new york markets.qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth $8bn. \"we would like to advise you that once we have completed our review of the verizon merger agreement, we do intend to submit a modified offer to acquire mci,\" the letter from qwest said. verizon's offer is made up of cash, shares and dividends, and a number of investors have said that it undervalues mci. verizon plans to swap 0.41 of its shares and $1.50 in cash for each mci share, as well as offering special dividends of $4.50 a share. both company boards have backed the deal, but regulators will still need to give their approval. as well as trying to lure investors with the promise of better returns, qwest also reckons that its offer will face less regulatory scrutiny than verizon's.the takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. earlier this month, sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. there may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as mci only emerged from bankruptcy protection last april. verizon is far bigger than qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. also, mci, while trading under the name worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in us history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the securities and exchange commission $250m in october to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep wall street happy.\n",
      "fiat chief takes steering wheelthe chief executive of the fiat conglomerate has taken day-to-day control of its struggling car business in an effort to turn it around.sergio marchionne has replaced herbert demel as chief executive of fiat auto, with mr demel leaving the company. mr marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years. fiat underperformed the market in europe last year, seeing flat sales.the car business has made an operating loss in five of the last six years and was forced to push back its break-even target from 2005 to 2006. the management changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following fiat's resolution of its dispute with general motors. as part of a major restructuring, fiat is to integrate the maserati car company - currently owned by ferrari - within its own operations. ferrari, in which fiat owns a majority stake, could be separately floated on the stock market in either 2006 or 2007.mr marchionne, who only joined the company last year, said fiat auto was now the \"principal focus\" of his attention. \"i have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the company's recovery,\" he said. \"a profound cultural transformation is underway following a management reorganisation that has delivered a more agile and efficient structure,\" he added.although mr marchionne does not have a background in the car industry, he has been playing an increasing role in the group's activities. last year, he said that a series of new models, launched as part of the group's recovery plan, had not boosted revenues as much as hoped. the car business, best known for its alfa romeo marque, is expected to make a loss of about 800m euros in 2004. sales are expected to fall in 2005, fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market. mr demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in november 2003 after being recruited by former fiat chief executive giuseppe morchio. mr morchio made a bid last year to become chairman after the death of president umberto agnelli. however, this was rejected by the founding agnelli family and mr morchio subsequently resigned. earlier this week, fiat reached an agreement with gm to dissolve an alliance which could have obliged gm to buy the italian firm outright. gm will pay fiat $2bn as part of the settlement.\n",

      "uk 'risks breaking golden rule'the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its \"golden rule\", a report suggests.the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects. the national institute of economic and social research (niesr) claims that taxes need to rise by about â£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. according to niesr, if the government's current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is \"unlikely\" the golden rule will be met. should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to \"50/50\". either way, fiscal tightening is needed, niesr said.the report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. earlier this month, accountancy firm ernst & young said that chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.it claimed revenues were likely to be â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was \"on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond\". \"spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable.\" other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the niesr report was optimistic about the state of the uk and global economy.it said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the \"world economy will continue to grow strongly\". global gross domestic product (gdp) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. the us will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in japan. hinting at better times for uk exporters, niesr said the euro zone \"is expected to pick up speed\".growth in britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. \"despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,\" niesr said, adding that \"the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery\". gdp is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. the main cloud on the horizon, niesr said, was the uk's much analysed and fretted over property market.\n",

      "ukraine steel sell-off 'illegal'the controversial sell-off of a ukrainian steel mill to a relative of the former president was illegal, a court has ruled.the mill, krivorizhstal, was sold in june 2004 for $800m (â£424m) - well below other offers. president viktor yushchenko, elected in december, is planning to revisit many of ukraine's recent privatisations. krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration.on wednesday, prime minister yulia tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed.mr yushchenko had previously said the list would be limited to 30-40 enterprises. more than 90,000 businesses in all, from massive corporations to tiny shopfronts, have been sold off since 1992, as the command economy built up when ukraine was part of the soviet union was dismantled. analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence.thursday's ruling by a district court in perchesk overturned a previous decision in a lower court permitting the sale. the consortium which won the auction for the mill was created by viktor pinchuk, son-in-law of former-president leonid kuchma, and rinat akhmetov, the country's richest man. the next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for krivorizhstal to be resold. mr yushchenko has suggested a fair valuation could be as much as $3bn. one of the foreign bidders who lost out, steel giant lnm, told bbc news that it would be interested in any renewed sale.\n",
      "cairn shares up on new oil findshares in cairn energy have jumped 6% after the firm said an indian oilfield was larger than previously thought.cairn said drilling to the north-west of its development site in rajasthan had produced \"very strong results\". the company also said it now believed the development area would be able to produce oil for more than 25 years. cairn's share price rose 300% last year after a number of oil finds, but its shares were hit in december following a disappointing drilling update. december's share fall means that cairn is still in danger of being relegated from the ftse 100 when the index is reshuffled next month. cairn's shares closed up 64 pence, or 6%, at 1130p on thursday.before christmas, cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day.however, on thursday, the group said its belief that the path of oil in the area actually moved further to the west had proved correct. \"this area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong,\" dr mike watts head of exploration said. chief executive bill gammell added: \"the more we progress in rajasthan the better we feel about it.\" cairn made the discovery after having been granted an extension to their drilling licence in january by indian authorities. the firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the mangala and aishwariya fields where cairn has previously announced major discoveries. it also said production at its other fields across the globe was likely to surpass levels seen in 2004.\n",
      "georgia plans hidden asset pardongeorgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president eduard shevardnadze.the country's new president, mikhail saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. the measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost georgia's flagging economy. georgia's black market is estimated to be twice the size of its legal economy.mr saakashvili, elected president in january after mr shevardnadze was toppled, has urged the georgian parliament to approve the amnesty as soon as possible. it is one of a series of proposals designed to tackle corruption, which was rampant during the shevardnadze era, and boost georgia's fragile public finances.the new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 january, three days before president saakashvili was elected. \"there are people who have money but are afraid to show it,\" the president told a government session. \"documentation about where this money came from doesn't exist because under the former, entirely warped regime, earning capital honestly was not possible.\"by declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to \"legalise their property\", mr saakashvili stressed.\"no one will have the right to check this money's origin. this money must go back into the economy.\" the amnesty will not extend to people who made money through drugs trafficking or international money laundering. criminal investigations in such cases -thought to involve about 5% of georgian businesses -are to continue. mr saakashvili has accused the shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in november, of allowing bribery to flourish. georgia's economy is in a desperate condition. half the population are living below the poverty line with many surviving on income of less than $4, or three euros, a day. the unemployment rate is around 20% while the country has a $1.7bn public debt.\n",
      "cuba winds back economic clockfidel castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba's ailing economy.all conversions between the us dollar and cuba's \"convertible\" peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10% tax. cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in cuba, will be affected. critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the cuban president's desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. in a live television broadcast announcing the measure, president castro's chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states' increasing \"economic aggression\". \"the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country,\" he said.the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months. president bush's government, which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on cuba, introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may.cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro's tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. \"i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash,\" says jose barrionuevo, head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital. \"it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue.\"the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. this money, known as remittances, can amount to as much as $1bn a year. those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax. their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax, such as euros, or increase their dollar payments to compensate. however, many of cuban's poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year, particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.cuba's tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and, according to the un economic commission for latin america, is now worth $3bn to the country.the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba's cash-strapped economy. cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food, fuel and medicine. much of cuba's basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. in recent weeks, cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. cuba's economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital, decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. however, a decline in foreign tourism since 2002, periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government's economic problems. the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, mr barrionuevo said. \"the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries, like venezuela, which have restrictions on capital,\" he says. mr barrioneuvo says the measure could be dropped if it has a damaging effect on economic activity. \"it is intended to be a permanent measure but i am not sure it can last too long.\"\n",

      "bush to outline 'toughest' budgetpresident bush is to send his toughest budget proposals to date to the us congress, seeking large cuts in domestic spending to lower the deficit.about 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (â£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant us budget deficit. defence spending will rise, however, while the proposals exclude the cost of continuing military operations in iraq. vice-president dick cheney said the budget was the \"tightest\" so far.at the heart of the administration's fifth budget, presented to congress on monday, is an austere package of domestic measures. these would see discretionary spending rise below the projected level of inflation.such belt-tightening is designed to tackle the massive budget deficit increases of president bush's first term. mr cheney admitted that the budget was the toughest of the bush presidency but argued it was \"fair and responsible\". \"it is not something we have done with a meat axe, nor are we suddenly turning our back on the most needy people in our society,\" he said. the wars in iraq and afghanistan, increased expenditure on national security after 9/11 and the 2001 recession wiped out the budget surplus inherited by president bush in 2001 and turned it into a record deficit. the shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005.education, environmental protection and transport initiatives are set to be scaled back as a first step towards reducing the deficit to $230bn by 2009.most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation's poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. spending on defence and homeland security is set to increase, although not by as much as originally planned. president bush's proposals would see the pentagon's budget rise by $19bn to $419.3bn while homeland security would get an extra $2bn.the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration in expected to seek an extra $80bn from congress later this year.also not featuring in the proposals is the cost of funding the administration's radical proposed overhaul of social security provision. some expects believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5bn trillion over a twenty year period. despite the republicans holding a majority in both houses of congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months.john mccain, a republican senator, said he was pleased the administration was prepared to tackle the deficit. \"with the deficits that we are now running, i am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget,\" he said. however, democratic senator kent conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. \"the cost of everything he [president bush] advocates explodes,\" he said.\n",

      "standard life cuts policy bonusesstandard life, europe's largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders.annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. it is the sixth time in three years standard life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. the insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates.with-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. profits made in good years are kept in reserve to pay investors an annual bonus even when the stock market performs badly. slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. standard life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. the insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. recently, norwich union and axa sun life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.john gill, managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only \"partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002\". in addition, low interest rates meant that \"long-term investment returns are well below historic levels\", mr gill added. however, mr gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. \"our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods,\" he said. standard life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders. last year, the company announced that it was looking to float on the stock market in 2006.\n",

      "gold falls on imf sale concernsthe price of gold has fallen after the international monetary fund (imf) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.by revaluing its holdings, the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations. the plan was put forward by g7 finance ministers over the weekend. the price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in asia, before rebounding slightly in early european trading.imf boss rodrigo rato was asked by g7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.he is expected to present his conclusions at an imf meeting in washington during april. \"whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the april imf meetings,\" said john reade, an analyst at ubs. the imf values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce, a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal's current market value. the imf has 3,217 tonnes of gold, or about 113.5m ounces. bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the imf's balance sheet, giving it more money to distribute.this idea has been put forward before, but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty. \"this is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a g7 communiqu&#233; for achieving debt relief,\" said uk chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown. at their meeting in london, g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries. mr brown said the meeting would be remembered as \"the 100% debt relief summit\". while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda, not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward. the us, which can veto any plan to sell imf gold should it so choose, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem. \"the us is not convinced that's the necessary way to do it,\" said treasury under secretary john taylor. canada, a key gold producer, also expressed reservations.\n",

      "us bank boss hails 'genius' smithus federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has given a speech at a scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist, adam smith.he delivered the 14th adam smith lecture in kirkcaldy, fife. the adam smith lecture celebrates the author of 1776's wealth of nations, which became a bible of capitalism. dr greenspan was invited by chancellor gordon brown, whose minister father john used to preach at the st bryce kirk church. mr brown introduced dr greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the \"the world's greatest economist\". dr greenspan, 79, who has been in the uk to attend the g7 meeting in london, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to smith, whose genius he compared to that of mozart.he said the philosopher was a \"towering contributor to the modern world\". \"kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of adam smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared. \"i am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor's renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area.\" he continued: \"smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. \"in so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living.\"dr greenspan said smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. \"the incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the enlightenment - especially with smith toiling in the environs of kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,\" he said. following his lecture, dr greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the queen at balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the royal society of edinburgh. he later opened an exhibition dedicated to smith in the atrium of fife college of further and higher education. joyce johnston, principal of the college, said: \"it is very fitting that the world's premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world's first economist.\" dr greenspan - who became chairman of the federal reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in june 2004 - will step down in january next year. he has served under presidents george w bush, bill clinton, george bush, and ronald reagan. he was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to gerald ford.\n",
      "economy 'strong' in election yearuk businesses are set to prosper during the next few months - but this could trigger more interest rate rises, according to a report.optimism is at its highest since 1997 and business will reap the benefits of a continuing rise in public spending, say researchers at bdo stoy hayward. the bank of england is expected to keep rates on hold this week - but they could go up later in the year. rates are likely to rise after the anticipated general election in may. the bdo optimism index - a leading indicator of gdp growth two quarters ahead edged up in january to 102.5, from 102.2 in october. the rise is due, in part, to an increase in public spending and increased merger and acquisition activity.the only thing blighting business optimism this year will be uncertainties associated with the general election, bdo said. its bdo's output index - which predicts gdp movements a quarter in advance - remained at 100.8 for january, implying gdp growth at 2.9% in the second quarter of 2005. however, the output index is being held back by recent interest rate rises, sterling's strength against the dollar and high oil prices, the group noted. its inflation index, which has risen continuously over the last 8 months, climbed to 110.0 in january from 108.0 in october last year. \"the uk is looking strong going into the general election, but businesses need to prepare themselves for a jolt ahead as the bank of england reacts to growth and inflationary pressures,\" said peter hemington, partner at bdo stoy hayward. \"growth will probably slow by the end of 2005 and it is likely that we will see higher interest rates or a sharp drop in demand for products and services.\"\n",
      "sec to rethink post-enron rulesthe us stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.in a speech at the london school of economics, william donaldson promised \"several initiatives\". european firms have protested that us laws introduced after the enron scandal make wall street listings too costly. the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanes-oxley act.the act comes into force in mid-2005. it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.firms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the securities and exchange commission (sec) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". there are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. the act also applies to firms with more than 300 us shareholders, a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in.the 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. mr donaldson said the sec would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements.\"we should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the us market into \"one with no exit\", he said. he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the act's least popular measure - section 404 - for foreign firms. seen as particularly costly to implement, section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including us ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (â£374m).a delegation of european firms visited the sec in december to press for change, the financial times reported.it was led by digby jones, director general of the uk's confederation of british industry (cbi) and included representatives of basf, siemens and cadbury schweppes. compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of us listings. air china picked the london stock exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (â£558m) stock market debut last month. there are also rumours that two chinese state-run banks - china construction bank and bank of china - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in new york later this year. instead, the cost of sarbanes-oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in hong kong, according to press reports in china.\n",

      "g7 backs africa debt relief plang7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.uk chancellor gordon brown said the london meeting of the world's seven richest nations would be remembered as \"the 100% debt relief summit\". some 37 countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the world bank and the imf, he said. but the us says it cannot support mr brown's international finance facility to boost aid to developing countries. bbc correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the uk's ambitions, but much work was needed. mr brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - \"the vast bulk\" of money owed by the poorest countries.\"we could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of,\" he said. he added: \"it is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor.\" but he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. bbc correspondent patrick bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. oxfam senior policy adviser max lawson welcomed the statement and said g7 ministers had \"passed the first hurdle of 2005\".but he added: \"they need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world's poorest. \"two million children will die needlessly between now and the next meeting in april. if rich countries are going to keep their promises to tackle obscene poverty they need deliver - and deliver quickly.\" talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. the international monetary fund (imf) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in april. mr brown said g7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005. but uk plans for an international finance facility (iff) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed. mr brown wanted to provide $10bn (â£5.38bn) a year over a decade, using g7 backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets.it is a key element of his proposals for a modern version of the marshall plan, which brought us aid to rebuild europe after world war ii, for the developing world. mr brown said it was \"winning support every day\" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the g8 summit in july. but us treasury under-secretary john taylor said the us could not support the iff because of its \"legislative process\". \"the us is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that,\" he said. \"but this particular mechanism does not work for the united states. it works for other countries, and that is fine.\" earlier, he told bbc radio 4's today programme the us had increased support for africa in the past four years from $1.1bn per year to $4.6bn per year. but south africa finance minister trevor manuel told the bbc's talking point programme what was needed was one approach, with all wealthy nations on board. he said much of the money pledged by the us had not yet been dispensed.the uk has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its 2005 presidency of the group of eight (g8), which comprises the g7 and russia. the g8 countries will meet at gleneagles in scotland. at a dinner on friday night, former south african president nelson mandela backed mr brown's plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off african debt and provide an extra $50bn (â£26.69bn) a year in aid for the next decade. talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of china and india, the us budget and trade deficits, how the us, europe and japan can act to boost global economic growth, and hiv/aids. g7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said \"excess volatility\" would impede economic growth. representatives from china, india, russia, south africa and brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions. a g8 summit is set to take place in july.\n",
      "q&a: malcolm glazer and man utdthe battle for control of manchester united has taken another turn after the club confirmed it had received a fresh takeover approach from us business tycoon malcolm glazer.no formal offer has been made yet, but manchester united have confirmed they have received a \"detailed proposal\" from the us entrepreneur which could lead to a bid. reports have put the offer at 300p per share, which would value manchester united at about â£800m ($1.5bn). the approach by the 76-year-old owner of the tampa bay buccaneers american football team is reportedly being led by his two sons, avi and joel. a previous approach to the united board by mr glazer in october last year was turned down. however, the bbc has learnt that the club is unlikely to reject the latest plan out of hand.mr glazer's previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. that would have left the club with debt levels which were deemed \"not... in the best interests of the company\" by manchester united's board when they rejected his approach last year. however, mr glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by â£200m.while united's board may be casting a serious eye over mr glazer's latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal.supporters' group shareholders united - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to mr glazer's campaign - said it would fight any move. \"manchester united are a debt-free company. we don't want to fall into debt and we don't need to fall into debt,\" shareholders united's sean bones told the bbc. united's players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. \"a lot of people want the club's interest to be with people who have grown up with the club and got its interests at heart,\" rio ferdinand told bbc radio five live. \"no-one knows what this guy will be bringing to the table.\"the key to any successful bid will be attracting the support of united's largest shareholders, the irish horse racing tycoons john magnier and jp mcmanus. through their cubic expression vehicle they own 28.9% of the club. mr glazer owns 28.1%. joe mclean, a football specialist at accountancy firm grant thornton, said the support of mr magnier and mr mcmanus was \"utterly crucial\". \"mr glazer's bid will not proceed without their support and they have previously indicated that they are holding their stake as an investment. \"if that's the case, the shares will therefore need a price attachment of about 300 pence, maybe 305. \"if that's the case then mr glazer might well secure their support - if he does, this bid could well go ahead.\"indeed it is. malcolm glazer was little-known in the uk until he started to build up his stake in manchester united in late 2003. in february 2004 he said he was \"considering\" whether to bid for the club. no bid emerged, but mr glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. in october 2004, manchester united said they had received a \"preliminary approach\", which turned out to have come from mr glazer. however, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve. at the club's annual general meeting in november, mr glazer took revenge by using his hefty stake in the club to oust three directors from the board. legal adviser maurice watkins, commercial director andy anson and non-executive director philip yea were voted out, against the wishes of chief executive david gill. but the move led to bankers jp morgan and public relations firm brunswick withdrawing from the glazer bid team.\n",
      "making your office work for youour mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time, we're taking a long hard look at your offices.over the next few months, our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work, and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient, more congenial or simply prettier. this week, we're hearing from marianne petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. click on the link under her photograph to read her story, and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. and if you want to take part in the series, go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.working from home presents a multitude of challenges. understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others? are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done? do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver?. in order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit, and to keep strict office hours. referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours, keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out, and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases, they have to be resurrected.prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability. it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.ideally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. this would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. ideally, it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour. the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. as for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.please click on the link to the right here to see my ideas for marianne's barn.the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting, while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house, your plan of going wireless is sensible. a wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient. however, important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass, which could result in a weak signal strength. you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. your local it supplier will be able to advise on this. if you haven't already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software, it is essential to do so, to protect your investment. to really take advantage of wireless technology, you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. or you could use one of the new tablet computers, which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. and finally, you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print, scan, copy and fax.\n",
      "market unfazed by aurora setbackas the aurora limped back to its dock on 20 january, a blizzard of photos and interviews seemed to add up to an unambiguous tale of woe.the ship had another slice of bad luck to add to its history of health scares and technical trouble. and its owner, p&o cruises - now part of the huge us carnival corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential pr fiasco. no-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. the warning of a five-cent hit to 2005 earnings came just 24 hours after one of the world's biggest investment banks had upped its target for carnival's share price, from â£35 to â£36.20. other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 gmt carnival's shares in london were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at â£32.26.why the mismatch between the public perception and the market's response? \"the aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time,\" says deutsche bank's simon champion. \"it was clearly a source of uncertainty for the company - it was a long cruise, after all. but the stock market is very good at treating these issues as one-off events.\"despite its string of bad luck, he pointed out, aurora is just one vessel in a large carnival fleet, the uk's p&o princess group having been merged into the much larger us firm in 2003. and generally speaking, carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. \"carnival has an incredibly strong track record,\" mr champion.similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. the hundreds of disappointed passengers who have now had to give up the opportunity to spend the next three months on the aurora have got both a refund and a credit for another cruise. that should mitigate some of the pr risk, both for carnival and its main competitor, royal caribbean. \"while not common, cancellations for technical reasons are not entirely unusual in the industry,\" wrote analysts from citigroup smith barney in a note to clients on friday. \"moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises.\" after all, the aurora incident may be big news in the uk - but for carnival customers elsewhere it's unlikely to make too much of a splash.assuming that citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in carnival's favour. in the wake of p&o princess's takeover by carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. given the expense of building, outfitting and running a cruise ship, \"slowing supply growth\" is a certainty, said david anders at merrill lynch on thursday. in other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited. and with carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated aurora in the future.\n",
      "the 'ticking budget' facing the usthe budget proposals laid out by the administration of us president george w bush are highly controversial. the washington-based economic policy institute, which tends to be critical of the president, looks at possible fault lines. us politicians and citizens of all political persuasions are in for a dose of shock therapy. without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. news coverage of the bush budget will be dominated by debates about spending cuts, but the fact is these will be large cuts in small programs. from the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the social security trust fund. as soon as 2018, the fund will begin to require some cash returns on its bond holdings in order to finance all promised benefits.the trigger for the coming shock will be rising federal debt, which will grow in 10 years, by conservative estimates, to more than half the nation's total annual output.this upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. even now, a growing share of us borrowing is from abroad. the us government cannot finance its operations without heavy borrowing from the central banks of japan and china, among other nations. this does not bode well for us influence in the world. the decline of the dollar is a warning sign that current economic trends cannot continue. the dollar is already sinking. before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. that will be the shock.interest-sensitive industries will feel pain immediately - sectors such as housing, automobiles, other consumer durables, agriculture, and small business. some will recall the news footage of angry farmers driving their heavy equipment around the us capitol in the late 1970s. there will be no need for constitutional amendments to balance the budget. the public outcry will force congress to act. whether it will act wisely is another matter. how did this happen?by definition, the deficit means too little revenue and too much spending - but this neutral description doesn't adequately capture the current situation. federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. in addition, the united states has two significant military missions. the bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one. reducing domestic spending, or eliminating \"waste, fraud and abuse\" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. indeed, if congress were rash enough to balance the budget in this way, there would hardly be any such spending left. law enforcement, space exploration, environmental clean-up, economic development, the small business administration, housing, veterans' benefits, aid to state and local governments would all but disappear. it's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. the biggest spending growth areas are defence (including homeland security), and health care for the elderly and the poor. to some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. the us population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. but serious savings can only be found where the big money is. savings in health care spending that do not come at the expense of health can only be achieved with wholesale reform of the entire system, public and private. brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent.on the revenue side, the lion's share of revenue lost to tax cuts enacted since 2000 will have to be replaced.some rearranging could hold many people harmless and focus most of the pain on those with relatively high incomes. finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. there is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. borrowing for investments in education and infrastructure that pay off in future years makes sense. the sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued. first on the list should be tax reform to raise revenue, simplify the tax code, and restore some fairness eroded by the bush tax cuts. second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to afghanistan, iraq, or terrorism. third must be the start of a serious debate on large-scale health care reform. one thing is certain - destroying the budget in order to save it is not going to equip the us economy and government for the challenges of this new century.\n",
      "ebbers 'aware' of worldcom fraudformer worldcom boss bernie ebbers was directly involved in the $11bn financial fraud at the firm, his closest associate has told a us court.giving evidence in the criminal trial of mr ebbers, ex-finance chief scott sullivan implicated his colleague in the accounting scandal at the firm. mr sullivan, worldcom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against mr ebbers. mr ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud.senior worldcom executives are accused of orchestrating a huge fraud at the former telecoms company in which they exaggerated revenues and hid the cost of expenses. the firm was forced into bankruptcy, the largest in us history. mr sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against mr ebbers.prosecutors have alleged that mr ebbers, 63, directed mr sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants. mr ebbers has denied all the charges, saying he was unaware of the fraud. his lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to mr sullivan.however, on monday mr sullivan named mr ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud. \"he [ebbers] has got a hands-on grasp of financial information,\" mr sullivan told a new york court. on his first day of questioning, mr sullivan admitted to falsifying the company's financial statements.\"we did not disclose these adjustments,\" he said. \"we did not talk about these adjustments and the information was false.\" mr sullivan said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as \"detail-oriented\".he portrayed mr ebbers, a charismatic businessman who built up worldcom from a small regional operator into one of america's largest telecoms firms, as obsessed with costs. \"he would talk about that there were more coffee filters than coffee bags and that means employees are taking coffee home,\" he said. \"we needed to cut expenses. we needed to cut a lot more than coffee expenses.\" mr sullivan is at the centre of the government's case against mr ebbers. mr ebbers could face a sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing.\n",
      "renault boss hails 'great year'strong sales outside western europe helped renault boost its profits by more than 40% in 2004 although the firm warned of lower margins this year.france's second largest carmaker enjoyed a healthy 43% rise in net profits to 2.4bn euros ($3.1bn; â£2.9bn) as sales rose 8% to 40.7bn euros. the firm said strong demand outside western europe and the good performance of its megane range lifted its results. chairman louis schweitzer said 2004 had been a \"great year\" for the firm.renault sold more than 2.4 million vehicles in 2004, an increase of 4% on the previous year. growth came mainly from outside western europe, with particularly strong sales in turkey, russia and north africa.in total, sales outside western europe - renault's core market - rose 16.5%. japanese carmaker nissan - in which renault owns a 44% stake - contributed 1.7bn euros in net income over the year. nissan chairman carlos ghosn is to succeed mr schweitzer at the head of renault later this year.renault said the outlook for the industry in europe this year was \"stable\", with small growth forecast in other regions. the firm will benefit from the launch of a new clio model in the coming year and the roll-out of the logan in many markets. however, the firm said it expected operating margins to be lower in 2005, at 4% of sales as opposed to 5%. \"in a sluggish market and an environment impacted by the rise in raw material prices, renault intends to continue to grow its global sales,\" the company said in a statement.\n",
      "survey confirms property slowdowngovernment figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the uk's housing market in late 2004.house prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004, down from 16.3% in the july-to-september quarter, the land registry said. the average house price in england and wales was â£182,920, down from â£187,971 in july-september. the volume of sales between october and december dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. the government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. land registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies, since they record completions not mortgage approvals. however, the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions, including cash sales.the cost of buying a home fell in seven out of 10 regions between the third and fourth quarters of 2004.the biggest annual gains were made in wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. house prices rose the slowest in greater london, being up by 6%. in the capital, the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36,185 in 2003 to 28,041 for the same period in 2004. there was also a decline in the number of million-pound properties sold in the capital, with 436 properties over â£1m sold compared to 469 for the same period in 2003. although the figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from nationwide and halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. after registering falls at the back end of 2004, halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in january and nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. members of the bank of england's rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on thursday.\n",
      "bush budget seeks deep cutbackspresident bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (â£230bn) this year.the $2.58 trillion (â£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. but foreign aid is due to rise by 10%, with more money to treat hiv/aids and reward economic and political reform. military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from congress later this year.congress will spend several months debating george w bush's proposal.the state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist us allies in the \"war on terror\". however, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv/aids, the bbc's jonathan beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to $3bn, with much of that money going to african nations. mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation. the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies. yet mr bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of social security, the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income.some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile. concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at agriculture and 5.6% at the environmental protection agency. the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush's presidency. \"in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,\" mr bush said in his budget message to congress. mr bush has promised to halve the us's massive budget deficit within five years. the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower. the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would \"sunset\", or disappear, in 2010. most republicans, however, want them to stay in place. and the figures also rely on the \"social security trust fund\" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.\n",
      "profits stall at china's lenovoprofits at chinese computer firm lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition.the firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the pc division of personal computer pioneer ibm. lenovo's profit for the three months to december was hk$327m (us$42m; â£22m), less than 1% up on the year before. chinese pc sales have risen by a fifth in each of the past two years, but are now growing more slowly. the company is still by far the biggest player in china, with more than a quarter of the market. but western firms such as dell and hewlett-packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in china, and lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to hk$6.31bn.if the $1.75bn agreement lenovo signed with ibm on 8 december goes through, it will mark the end of an era. ibm pioneered the desktop pc market in the early 1980s, although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. in any case, margins in pc market are now wafer thin, and profits have been hard to come by for most vendors except direct-sales giant dell. but investors have been less than impressed with lenovo's move, designed to take it out of china and further onto the world stage. its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago, largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying. there have been rumours that the deal could be in trouble because us government agencies fear it could offer china opportunities for industrial espionage. the reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent lenovo's shares up 6% in late january.\n",
      "mci shares climb on takeover bidshares in us phone company mci have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks.the wall street journal reported on thursday that qwest has bid $6.3bn (â£3.4bn) for mci. other firms have also expressed an interest in mci, the second-largest us long-distance phone firm, and may now table rival bids, analysts said. shares in mci, which changed its name from worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15. press reports suggest that qwest and mci may reach an agreement as early as next week, although rival bids may muddy the waters. the largest us telephone company verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with mci, reuters quoted sources as saying.consolidation in the us telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. a merger between mci and qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october. last week, sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. competition has intensified and fixed-line phone providers such as mci and at&t have seen themselves overtaken by rivals. buying mci would give qwest, a local phone service provider, access to mci's global network and business-based subscribers. mci also offers internet services.mci was renamed after it emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in april last year. it hit the headlines as worldcom in 2002 after admitting it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. the scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today. shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud.\n",
      "bt offers equal access to rivalsbt has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals.the move comes after telecom regulator ofcom said in november that the firm must offer competitors \"real equality of access to its phone lines\". at the time, ofcom offered bt the choice of change or splitting into two. ofcom is carrying out a strategic review aimed at promoting greater competition in the uk telecom sector. bt's competitors have frequently accused it of misusing its status as the former telecoms monopoly and controller of access to many customers to favour its own retail arm.this latest submission was delivered to the watchdog ahead of a deadline for the second phase of its review.\"central to the proposals are plans by bt to offer operators lower wholesale prices, faster broadband services and transparent, highly-regulated access to bt's local network,\" the former monopoly said in a statement. \"the united kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world,\" bt chief executive ben verwaayen said. \"bt has a critical role to play, and today we are making a set of far-reaching proposals towards that framework,\" he said. bt wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes, as well as the removal of the break-up threat.the group is to set up a new access services division - with a separate board which would include independent members - to ensure equal access for rivals to the \"local loop\", the copper wires that run between telephone exchanges and households. the company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from april in areas of high customer demand.it added that it plans to invest â£10bn in the next five years to create a \"21st century network\". to meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, bt said it would begin trials in april with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn.telecom analysts ovum welcomed the move, saying bt had \"given a lot of ground\".\"the big question now is whether the industry, and particularly ofcom feels bt's proposals go far enough ...now the real negotiation begins,\" director of telecoms research tony lavender said. internet service provider (isp) plus.net also backed the proposals saying \"we will be entirely happy if ofcom accepts them\". \"bt has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. the scenario now is how well people execute their business plans as a service provider,\" chief executive lee strafford said. chris panayis, managing director of isp freedom2surf said that it would make the situation clearer for business. \"i think it's the first productive thing we've had from bt,\" he said.aol backed the price cuts but said regulation was still needed to ensure a level playing field. \"this is a reminder to ofcom that as long as bt can change the dynamics of the whole broadband market at will, the process of opening up the uk's local telephone network to infrastructure investment and competition remains fragile,\" a spokesman said. \"ofcom needs to return to regulation of the wholesale broadband service [ipstream] and provide more robust rules for local loop unbundling if consumers are to see the benefits of increased competition and infrastructure investment.\" more than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase. ofcom is expected to spend the next few weeks examining the proposals before making an announcement within the next few months.\n",
      "jobs growth still slow in the usthe us created fewer jobs than expected in january, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.according to labor department figures, us firms added only 146,000 jobs in january. the gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since september 2001. the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office. he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last november's presidential election - the first president to do so since herbert hoover. as a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. however, when adding december and january's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. \"it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,\" said rick egelton, deputy chief economist at bmo financial group. \"we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment.\" \"the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,\" said ken mayland, president of clearview economics. \"that means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.\"\n",

      "call to overhaul uk state pensionthe uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.the pensions policy institute (ppi) said replacing the state pension with a \"citizen's pension\" would help tackle inequality and complexity. the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance (ni) contributions. reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records.the ppi added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. the think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commission's initial report into uk retirement savings. according to the pensions commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. as a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of uk pensioners. the report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis.\n",

      "turkey knocks six zeros off liraturkey is to relaunch its currency on saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy.the change will see the end of such dizzyingly-high denominations as five million lira - enough for a short taxi ride - and the 20m note, worth $15. these valuations were the product of decades of inflation which, as recently as 2001, was as high as 70%. inflation has since been tamed and economic prospects are improving.the currency - officially to be known as the new lira - will be launched at midnight on 1 january. from that point, the one-million lira note will become the new one-lira coin. the government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the european union.on an everyday level, it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and turks alike. \"the transition to the new turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years,\" said sureyya serdengecti, head of the turkish central bank. \"the new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years.\"the turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs.turkey had to turn to the international monetary fund for financial assistance, accepting a $18bn loan in return for pushing through a wide-ranging austerity programme. these tough measures have borne fruit. inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30% this year. meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. the government hopes that the new currency will cement the country's economic progress, two weeks after eu leaders set a date for the start of turkey's accession talks.the slimmed-down lira is likely to be widely welcomed by the business community.\"the turkish lira has been like funny money,\" tevfik aksoy, chief turkish economist for deutsche bank, told associated press. \"now at least in cosmetic terms it will look like real currency.\" however, some do not feel quite so happy about seeing the nominal value of their investments reduced. \"if a person has 10 billion lira in investments this will suddenly decrease,\" shop owner hayriye evren, told associated press. \"this will definitely affect people psychologically.\"\n",

      "asia shares defy post-quake gloomindonesian, indian and hong kong stock markets reached record highs.investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on asia's listed firms. \"obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,\" said abn amro's eddie wong. \"[but] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.\"india's bombay stock exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on wednesday. expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the indonesian stock exchange in jakarta to a record high on wednesday. in hong kong, the hang seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of south east asia. in sri lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. sri lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.thailand may lose 30bn baht (â£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister sontaya kunplome.in the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. \"it will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,\" said naris chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. in the maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. \"our nation is in peril here,\" said ahmed shaheed, the chief government spokesman. he estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. the maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. \"it won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our gdp,\" he said. \"in the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the united nations recognised this. now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes.\" shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.however, many experts, including the world bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. in part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. \"calculators will have to wait,\" said an imf official in a briefing on wednesday. \"the financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.\"\n",
      "booming markets shed few tearsthe market, former british government minister michael heseltine once said, has no morality.and indeed, stock exchange traders around asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster. stock markets in indonesia and india have hit all-time highs this week; even in sri lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. the msci world share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the bbc global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. and this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts.in fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.for a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. the overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from india, only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance, and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. and where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring jakarta stock exchange are in oil, technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. tourist businesses, the most likely sufferers, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. those that are listed have suffered: confifi hotel holdings, a small sri lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. but there are winners as well as losers. asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. in indonesia, shares in state construction companies adhi karya and semen gresik have jumped sharply this week.more broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact.according to the natural hazards research and applications information center at colorado state university, there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. the need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. a study of the 1993 des moines floods, from the disaster research center at the university of delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off. \"although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, our research indicates that most businesses, even those that are especially hard-hit, do indeed recover,\" the authors concluded.but disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.in particular, many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system, as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. in fact, again, the risks here are lower than they seem. even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. a series of recent shocks, the colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. the trillion-dollar debts of japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than tokyo. and the us stock market was on its way down long before 11 september, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks. \"it is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings,\" one bombay trader said this week. \"but the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.\"\n",

      "could yukos be a blessing in disguise?other things being equal, the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.but in the looking-glass world of modern russia, the opposite might just be true, a new report* has argued. the study, from the centre for economic policy research, does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms, even targets of the tax police. \"an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,\" the authors say.the paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.after vladimir putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort - too much, critics argue - into enforcement.since then, the russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft, a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power, the company's overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.does this analysis make sense? in part, certainly. for all its faults, corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment, long negligible, is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors' model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.and the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos' founder, mikhail khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.\n",
      "nasdaq planning $100m share salethe owner of the technology-dominated nasdaq stock index plans to sell shares to the public and list itself on the market it operates.according to a registration document filed with the securities and exchange commission, nasdaq stock market plans to raise $100m (â£52m) from the sale. some observers see this as another step closer to a full public listing. however nasdaq, an icon of the 1990s technology boom, recently poured cold water on those suggestions.the company first sold shares in private placements during 2000 and 2001. it technically went public in 2002 when the stock started trading on the otc bulletin board, which lists equities that trade only occasionally. nasdaq will not make money from the sale, only investors who bought shares in the private placings, the filing documents said. the nasdaq is made up shares in technology firms and other companies with high growth potential. it was the most potent symbol of the 1990s internet and telecoms boom, nose-diving after the bubble burst. a recovery in the fortunes of tech giants such as intel, and dot.com survivors such as amazon has helped revive its fortunes.\n",
      "giving financial gifts to childrenyour child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new child trust fund. the first vouchers, worth â£250 or â£500 for low-income families, will be distributed from january. all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible. parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005.parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to â£1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of â£1 and the alliance & leicester firstsaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at â£1.interest earned by children is subject to income tax. however, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (â£4,745 for the current tax year).if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. when the account is opened a form \"r85\", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. only â£100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual â£1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.another favourite solution is premium bonds. with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian. the minimum for each purchase is â£100 and bonds are sold in multiples of â£10.there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.over the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. these funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the ftse 100. exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). the difference is that the charges are quite low. the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.\n",

      "oil prices reach three-month lowoil prices have fallen heavily for a second day, closing at three-month lows after news that us crude stocks have improved ahead of winter.london brent crude closed at $40.15 on thursday - a drop of 5.1% - having dived below $40 a barrel for the first time since mid-september. us light crude traded in new york lost more than $2 to $43.25, its lowest close since 10 september. the price of both benchmark crudes has dropped 12% in two days. the falls were triggered when the energy information administration (eia) said on wednesday that us crude stocks were 3.5% higher than a year ago. the news calmed worries about winter shortages. weak us fuel and heating oil stocks have been a persistent factor in pushing up oil prices. \"it's amazing how quickly sentiment changed,\" said rick mueller, an analyst at energy security analysis. analysts also attributed the fall to mild early-winter weather, which has tempered demand for heating oil.the stronger fuel inventories helped boost us stock markets to nine-month highs on wednesday, though only the nasdaq index had hung onto those gains by the end of thursday.in london, the ftse 100 index closed 15 points higher at 4,751. the long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. however, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in north america this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world.the price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late october. opec nations have increased production to 25-year highs to meet global demand and this has helped rebuild us stocks hit by supply disruptions after hurricane ivan in september. traders were also encouraged by comments on wednesday from the energy minister of opec member algeria. chakib khelil said the cartel was likely to keep output unchanged when it meets next week. however, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output.fears still remain over the level of us heating oil stocks, which are rising but remain down on 2004 levels. a cold spell in north america would start to deplete supplies and could spark further price rises. analysts, however, say prices will fall further if inventories continue to rise. \"mother nature is going to be huge in the next several weeks,\" said kyle cooper, at citigroup global markets. \"long term i think we're headed to $30-35 but i don't think we're doing that yet. we have a lot of winter left.\" john person, president of national futures advisory services, said the eia data indicated there should be adequate supplies for the next three months in the us. .\n",

      "markets fall on weak dollar fearsrising oil prices and the sinking dollar hit shares on monday after a finance ministers' meeting and stern words from fed chief alan greenspan.the london ftse fell 0.8% while tokyo's nikkei 225 dropped 2.11%, its steepest fall in three months. g20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in japan and europe. and mr greenspan warned asian states could soon stop funding the us deficit.on monday afternoon, the euro was close to an all-time high against the dollar at above $1.30. oil pushed higher too on monday, as investors fretted about cold weather in the us and europe and a potential output cut from oil producers' group opec, although prices had cooled by the end of the day. in london, the benchmark brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while new york light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. the slide comes as the us has been attempting to talk up the traditional \"strong dollar\" policy.the latest to pitch in has been president george w bush himself, who told the asia pacific economic co-operation (apec) summit in chile that he remained committed to halving the budget deficit. together with a $500bn trade gap, the red ink spreading across america's public finances is widely seen as a key factor driving the dollar lower. and last week us treasury secretary john snow told an audience in the uk that the policy remained unaltered. but he also said that the rate was entirely up to the markets - a signal which traders took as advice to sell the dollar. some had looked to the g20 meeting for direction. but mr snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda.for the us government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix.us exports get more affordable, helping perhaps to close the trade gap. in the meantime, the debt keeps getting bigger, with congress authorising an $800bn rise in what the us can owe - taking the total to $8.2 trillion. but in a speech on friday, federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned that in the longer term things are likely to get tricky. at present, much of gap in both public debt is covered by selling bonds to asian states such as japan and china, since the dollar is seen as the world's reserve currency. similarly, asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the us as a whole spends and what it earns. but already they are turning more cautious - an auction of debt in august found few takers. and mr greenspan said that could turn into a trend, if the fall of the dollar kept eating into the value of those investments. \"it seems persuasive that, given the size of the us current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point,\" he said.\n",

      "turkey turns on the economic charmthree years after a gruelling economic crisis, turkey has dressed its economy to impress.as part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 december, when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks - turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. the economy is growing fast, they insist. education levels among its young and large population are rising. unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. inflation is under control. a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (â£10.8bn) in three years.moreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund (imf) is pretty much in the can. and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.the point of all this has been to convince europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu, allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.\"the cake will be bigger for everybody,\" said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month. \"turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget.\" if admitted into the eu, turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; â£6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's state planning organisation. as turkey's gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in \"old europe\" once its population comes of age. by 2014, one in four turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. \"a literate and qualified turkish population,\" insisted mr sener, \"will make a positive impact on the eu.\"this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers' wallets. however, turkey's assertions are confirmed by brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy. but only over time. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country's farm sector, which currently employs one in three turks, would employ just one in five by 2020.such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned.some fear that rather than providing an educated, sophisticated labour force for europe at large, the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor, uneducated - and plentiful. more recently, less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced, with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a \"river of islam\", an \"oriental\" culture and a threat to europe's \"cultural richness\". of course, many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country's muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government's human rights record. yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country's current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.the country's massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu. \"in the new member states of the european union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,\" says reza moghadam, assistant director of the imf's european department. \"at about 80% of gdp, turkey's gross debt is double that figure.\" turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession. \"there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,\" says michael deppler, director of the imf's european department. \"its debt is far too high for an emerging economy.\" a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria. but economics is not a science. and although the state of turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.\n",
      "sbc plans post-takeover job cutsus phone company sbc communications said it expects to cut around 12,800 jobs following its $16bn (â£8.5bn) takeover of former parent at&t.sbc said 5,125 positions would go as a result of network efficiencies. another 1,700 will go from its sales department, 3,400 from business operations and 2,600 across legal, advertising and public relations. sbc currently employs 163,000 people while at&t employs 47,000. the takeover was announced on monday. the deal will be financed with $15bn of shares as well as a $1bn special dividend paid to at&t shareholders.it effectively marks the end of at&t, which was founded in 1875 by telephone pioneer alexander graham bell and is one of the us's best-known companies. sbc and at&t said estimated cost savings of at least $2bn from 2008 were a main driver for the merger. at&t is a long-distance telecoms firm, while sbc is mainly focused on the local market in the western us. both also have data network businesses. the takeover is subject to approval by at&t's shareholders and regulators. the companies said they expected to complete the agreement during the first half of 2006.\n",
      "german bidder in talks with lsedeutsche boerse bosses have held \"constructive, professional and friendly\" talks with the london stock exchange (lse), its chief has said.werner seifert met lse chief executive clara furse amid rumours the german group may raise its bid to â£1.5bn ($2.9bn) from its initial â£1.3bn offer. however, rival suitor euronext also upped the ante in the bid battle. ahead of talks with the lse on friday, the pan-european bourse said it may be prepared to make its offer in cash. the paris-based exchange, owner of liffe in london, is reported to be ready to raise â£1.4bn to fund a bid.the news came as deutsche boerse held its third meeting with the lse since its bid approach in december which was turned down by the london exchange for undervaluing the business. however, the lse did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a \"significantly-improved proposal\" would be in the interests of lse's shareholders and customers. in the meantime, euronext, which combines the paris, amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the lse. in a statement on thursday, euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: \"there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made.\" a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange. however, neither side has made a formal offer for the lse, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.deutsche boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by mr seifert with ms furse were plans to move the management of its cash and eurex derivatives market to london, as well as two members of its executive board. but, hans reckers, a board member of germany's central bank, the bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in frankfurt, something deutsche boerse could move to the uk. \"it is not just the headquarters of the boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in frankfurt. this has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,\" he said. local government officials in frankfurt's state of hessen have also spoken out against the move. \"it is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental europe,\" alois rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added.\n",
      "amex shares up on spin-off newsshares in american express surged more than 8% on tuesday after it said it was to spin off its less profitable financial advisory subsidiary.the us credit card to travel services giant said off-loading american express financial advisors (aefa) would boost its profitability. aefa has more than 12,000 advisers selling financial advice, funds and insurance to 2.5 million customers. over the years it has delivered poor profits and even some losses.\"this is an excellent move by american express to focus on its core businesses, and sell off a laggard division, which has been a problem for quite some time,\" said marquis investment research analyst phil kain. analysts estimate that a stand-alone aefa could have a market value of $10bn (â£5.3bn). the unit was acquired by american express 20 years ago as investors diversified service, of minneapolis, at a time when firms were amassing one-stop financial empires. however, the business of selling investments was never integrated with the rest of the group.\n",
      "axa sun life cuts bonus paymentslife insurer axa sun life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.regular annual bonus rates on former axa equity & law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. the cut will hit an estimated 3% of axa's policyholders. the rest will know their fate in march.the cuts on axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested â£50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of â£46,998. this equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% axa said. with-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. however, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. \"the stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002,\" axa spokesman mark hamilton, axa spokesman, told bbc news. axa cut payouts for the same investors last january.\n",
      "chinese dam firm 'defies beijing'the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said.the builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. the xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. the beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. the firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant.so far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. the china three gorges project corp could now face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000; â£12,700). last week, it denied that its projects violated regulations. \"the three gorges corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,\" it said.the sepa order comes as the chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country's booming economy. previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages, which forced many factories into part-time working last year. in 2004, china increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (mw). the xiluodu dam is designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity, and is being built on the jinshajiang - or \"river of golden sand\" as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. it is a sister project to the main three gorges dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated, drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.\n",
      "stock market eyes japan recoveryjapanese shares have ended the year at their highest level since 13 july amidst hopes of an economic recovery during 2005.the nikkei index of leading shares gained 7.6% during the year to close at 11,488.76 points. in 2005 it \"will rise toward 13,000\", predicted morgan stanley equity strategist naoki kamiyama. the optimism in the financial markets contrast sharply with pessimism in the japanese business community. earlier this month, the quarterly tankan survey of japanese manufacturers found that business confidence had weakened for the first time since march 2003.slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall in confidence. despite this, traders expect strength in the global economy to benefit japan, which has been close to sliding into recession in recent months. structural reform within japan and an anticipated end to the banking sector's bad debt problems should also help, they say.\n",
      "iraqi voters turn to economic issuesbeyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters.a vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. \"first rule of law, then the economy,\" says radwan hadi, deputy managing director of aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services, which entered iraq in 2003. mr hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. the economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday's election, according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war iraq.job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people's wish list. nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. \"estimates of iraq's unemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40%,\" the washington-based independent think-tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index. but some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since june 2003.iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad's pharmacies. observes mr hadi: \"the economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer.\" an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles. hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq, the jordanian investment bank export & finance bank has bought 49% of national bank of iraq.foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. bechtel's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes ms alexander. \"it is seen as a selling off of iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers,\" she says. consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of iraqi assets, she explains. in the west, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. opinion polls suggest that \"people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things\", ms alexander says.yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists mr hadi, an iraqi who left the country three decades ago. \"i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,\" mr hadi says. \"iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth.\"many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. but there are exceptions. mr hadi's blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. blackwatch's baghdad-based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, mr hadi points out. \"these guys are trying to work. the iraqi business people will do business at all times. \"life goes on in iraq, the people take responsibility, they want to live normal lives.\"\n",
      "eu 'too slow' on economic reformsmost eu countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says.the study, undertaken by the european commission, sought to assess how far the eu has moved towards meeting its economic targets. in 2000, eu leaders at a summit in lisbon pledged the european economy would outstrip that of the us by 2010. their economic targets became known as the lisbon agenda. but the commission report says that, in most eu countries, the pace of economic reform has been too slow, and fulfilling the lisbon ambitions will be difficult - if not impossible.only the uk, finland, belgium, denmark, ireland and the netherlands have actually followed up policy recommendations. among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are greece and italy. the lisbon agenda set out to increase the number of people employed in europe by encouraging more older people and women to stay in the workforce. it also set out to raise the amount the private sector spends on research and development, while bringing about greater discipline over public spending and debt levels. combined with high environmental standards and efforts to level the playing field for businesses throughout the eu, the plan was for europe to become the world's most dynamic economy by 2010. next week, the commission will present revised proposals to meet the lisbon goals. many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.\n",
      "china continues breakneck growthchina's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%.the news may mean more limits on investment and lending as beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. but officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. and overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. the result could be higher interest rates. china raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in october 2004.despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"there is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said tim congdon, economist at ing barings.china's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, china's currency. the government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the us dollar, - much to the chagrin of many us lawmakers who blame china for lost jobs and competitiveness. despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \"we need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,\" national bureau of statistics chief li deshui told reuters. \"those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"\n",
      "japan's ageing workforce: built to lastin his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. and the 101-year-old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.mr toshitsune is one of japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. at his neat osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony. between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: \"well, what's most important for me is to be japan's number one.\" mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. and when it comes to longevity, japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than americans and europeans.on the outskirts of kyoto, 83-year-old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in their seventies.\"i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,\" he remarks. \"on average, we can live longer.\" whether it's the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, japan's elderly are remarkable. but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us.by 2007, japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.\"in the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,\" explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo. so how will japan's finances stay on track? after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country's gross domestic product (gdp), the highest rate among industrialised countries. the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of gdp, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. but unfortunately, japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. glen wood, vice president of deutsche securities japan, asks; \"who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker? \"who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward?\" one option is further welfare reform. another is immigration, possibly from the philippines and indonesia. but so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff.standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york's statue of liberty. but, as yet, japan is not ready for an ellis island.\"japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,\" insists mr wood. in japan, as in europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. but for the japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.of course the japanese could always have more children. the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia. but there would be no pay back until 2030, when today's babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in europe, starts to unfold in 2010. in contrast to japan - and of course the european union - the us population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. although president bush must re-devise social security to take account of a 130% rise in america's over 65s, the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration.some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market. they want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over the country's ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. \"japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,\" says mr wood. japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. come 2020, japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. there are fears that the world's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. but none of this is mr toshitsune's concern anymore. at 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine.\n",

      "uk economy facing 'major risks'the uk manufacturing sector will continue to face \"serious challenges\" over the next two years, the british chamber of commerce (bcc) has said.the group's quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. the rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. however, the bcc found the whole uk economy still faced \"major risks\" and warned that growth is set to slow. it recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006.manufacturers' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, the survey of 5,196 firms found. employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year.\"despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing,\" the bcc said. \"these results reinforce our concern over the sector's persistent inability to sustain recovery.\" the outlook for the service sector was \"uncertain\" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the bcc noted.the bcc found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. the reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. the bank of england raised interest rates five times between november 2003 and august last year. but rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output. \"the pressure on costs and margins, the relentless increase in regulations, and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems,\" bcc director general david frost said. \"while consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.\"\n",
      "bank holds interest rate at 4.75%the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain's retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade.\"today's no change decision is correct,\" said david frost, director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc). \"but, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"mr frost added: \"the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"it is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in november, matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. manufacturers' organisation, the eef, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\"so far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said eef chief economist, steve radley. \"however, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.\n",
      "tobacco giants hail court rulingus tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn (â£155bn) claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers.tobacco stocks rose sharply on wall street after the 2-1 decision. the court in washington found the case - filed by the clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the justice department has not said if it will appeal. among the accused were altria group, rj reynolds tobacco, lorillard tobacco, liggett group and brown and williamson. they were delighted by the decision, which sent reynolds shares up 4.5% and altria shares up 5.11%.charles a blixt, executive vice-president of rj reynolds tobacco, said the ruling \"dramatically transforms\" the government's lawsuit. altria group said, in a statement, the government now \"must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future.\"the government had claimed tobacco firms - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary.prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to \"disgorge\" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. they brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes. but the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. they also said they had already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. the three-judge panel in the district of columbia's court of appeals ruled on friday that the us government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. judge david sentelle, in his ruling, said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward. \"we hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case,\" he wrote. the justice department refused to say if it would appeal. \"all we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it,\" a spokeswoman said on friday. but william corr of the campaign for tobacco-free kids urged the government to continue pressing its case. \"today's ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook,\" he said.\n",
      "steady job growth continues in usthe us created fewer jobs than expected in december, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.according to labor department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. that took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the us economy. while worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. the unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in december, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\"it was a respectable report,\" said michael moran, analyst at daiwa securities.\"payroll growth in december was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\" \"manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\" that means that the federal reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. the fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the us economic recovery was becoming more robust.job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the us economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the us presidential election. while demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \"overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and i expect that to be the case\" in 2005, said kurt karl, economist at swiss re in new york. meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the federal reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in november. a fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all us economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. but economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.\n",
      "glazer makes new man utd approachmalcolm glazer has made a fresh approach to buy manchester united, which could lead to a bid valuing the premiership club at â£800m.the us tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the united board with \"detailed proposals\", it has confirmed. mr glazer, who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last november.man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. last week, however, mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid.meanwhile, united's chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with \"definitive proposals\". now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back, with a statement issued on sunday reading: \"the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer. \"a further announcement will be made in due course.\"to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus, who own 28.9% of the club. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sunday's announcement they vowed to fight on. \"we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. we do not want him or anybody else taking over united,\" said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters' association. \"the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club.\"\n",
      "wall street cheers bush victorythe us stock market has closed higher in response to george w bush's victory in the presidential elections.the benchmark dow jones share index closed more than 1% higher at 10,137, while the nasdaq rose 0.9% to 2,004. many investors believe that mr bush's policies are more business-friendly than those of his democrat challenger, john kerry. the higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll.investors had worried that the outcome of the poll would be inconclusive, paving the way for a repeat of the legal wrangling that marred the 2000 election.the dow lost 5% of its value in the three weeks immediately after that election, when it was unclear who would occupy the white house. mr kerry conceded defeat on wednesday, abandoning last-ditch hopes of carrying the vote in the swing state of ohio. \"the relief for the markets may be that we have a decision and can move forward,\" said tim ghriskey, chief investment officer of solaris asset management. some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived, saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the us economy. \"i would look at the stock market rally for bush as kind of a one-day event,\" said ken mayland at clearview economics. the us' recent economic performance has been mixed, with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures, and mounting worries over a record budget deficit. elsewhere in the financial markets on wednesday, the dollar dipped slightly against the euro and climbed against the yen, while us oil prices closed up $1.26 at $50.88 a barrel in new york. the rise in oil prices partly reflects the view that president bush is less likely than mr kerry to release supplies from the us' strategic oil reserve. share prices in london, frankfurt and paris also closed higher.successive polls in the run-up to tuesday's election had shown the two candidates running neck and neck.economic issues, as well as the war in iraq, were the forefront of the campaign. in key swing states such as ohio, which has suffered substantial job losses in the past four years, president bush's handling of the economy became a crucial election issue. senator kerry attacked president bush's economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office. president bush focused on the fact that two million jobs have been created in the past year, claiming that it has vindicated his tax-cutting agenda. as for future policies, both candidates pledged to bring america's $422bn federal budget deficit under control. senator kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than $200,000 a year. president bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term. however, economists have said both candidates' economic programmes rested on questionable assumptions about future growth.\n",
      "business confidence dips in japanbusiness confidence among japanese manufacturers has weakened for the first time since march 2003, the quarterly tankan survey has found.slower economic growth, rising oil prices, a stronger yen and weaker exports were blamed for the fall. december's confidence level was below that seen in september, the bank of japan said. however, september's reading was the strongest for 13 years. \"the economy is at a pause but unlikely to fall\", the economy minister said. \"it will feel a bit slower (next year) than this year, and growth may be a bit more gentle but the situation is that the recovery will continue,\" said economy minister heizo takenaka. in the bank of japan's december survey, the balance of big manufacturers saying business conditions are better, minus those saying they are worse, was 22, down from 26 in september.japan's economy grew by just 0.1% in the three months to september, according revised data issued this month. with the recovery slowing, the world's second biggest economy is now expected grow by 0.2% in 2004. the tankan index is based on a survey of 10,227 firms. big manufacturers were even more pessimistic about the first quarter of 2005; their views suggest the march reading could go as low as 15 - still in positive territory, but weaker. the dollar's decline has strengthened the yen, making japanese exports more expensive in the us. china's attempts to cool down its fast-growing economy have also hit japanese industry's sales abroad. confidence among non-manufacturers was unchanged in the final quarter of 2004, but it is forecast to drop one point in the march survey. nonetheless, japanese firms have been stepping up capital investment, and the survey found the pace is quickening. companies reported they expect to invest 7.7% more in the year to march 2005 than the previous year - up from expectations of 6.1% increase in the september tankan.\n",

      "brazil approves bankruptcy reforma major reform of brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.the bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of president luiz inacio lula da silva. the old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. the new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. the new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. however, when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.the proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties, including mr lula's worker party. they considered that they undermined workers' rights. but president lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. nevertheless, mr adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the central bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.\n",

      "cairn shares slump on oil setbackshares in cairn energy, a uk oil firm, have closed down 18% after a disappointing drilling update and a warning over possible tax demands.the company said tests had shown no significant finds in one of its indian oil fields, but was upbeat about the potential of other areas. it also said the indian government had told it to pay a production tax, for which cairn argues it is not liable. cairn's shares have jumped by almost 400% this year. investors had piled into cairn after the company announced significant oil finds in india this year. chief executive bill gammell said on friday he was \"disappointed\" with exploration in the so-called n-c extension area in rajasthan. investors had held high hopes of major oil finds in this area. but cairn said estimates had been revised in what was a \"significant downgrade of the initial expectation\".cairn also said that the government believed the company was liable to pay taxes under its production-sharing contract. the company said the rate would be about 900 rupees ($20.40; â£10.50) per tonne, or seven barrels, of oil. a spokesman for the firm said that the tax would wipe 5% of the field's current value.\"cairn refutes the government's position,\" mr gammell said. he insisted that the contract made it clear that the tax should be shouldered by the licensee - india's state-run oil & natural gas corp (ongc) - and not the contractor. \"we have a pretty strong legal case here,\" he added, saying it would only become an issue once the firm started production. investors took a dim view of the statements though. the shares closed down 247p, or 18%, at 1115 pence. \"i think people were slightly over-ambitious for how quickly cairn would be able to develop and potentially offload these reserves,\" said analyst jason kenney at ing.the disappointments overshadowed increased production targets for cairn's existing oilfields. the company raised targets for its mangala and aishwariya fields in india from 60,000 barrels a day to between 80,000 and 100,000 barrels a day. its mangala field, thought to contain a billion barrels, is its biggest find to date. \"these two fields will provide the core of the future developments in rajasthan,\" mr gammell said. cairn added that it would be appraising another field early next year. mr gammell set up the company in the 1980s and has successfully switched its focus to south asia from interests in the us and europe. cairn, which also operates in nepal and bangladesh, was catapulted into the ftse 100 index of leading uk shares earlier this year after the sharp rise in its share price.\n",

      "no seasonal lift for house marketa swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market.the council of mortgage lenders (cml), british bankers association (bba) and building societies association (bsa) all said mortgage lending was slowing. cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in november as the number of people buying new homes fell. elsewhere, the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by â£4m in november, compared to october's â£4.29m. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since february 2003.data from the cml showed lending fell to just over â£25bn in november, from â£25.5bn a year earlier. separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year, at a seasonally-adjusted â£2.98bn. the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a \"winter sale\" and slash prices by up to 8%. miles shipside, commercial director at rightmove, said sellers would have to be \"more realistic with their asking prices\" to tempt buyers. the average asking price of a home fell by more than â£600 from â£190,329 in november to â£189,733 in december, while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago. \"even once the quieter holiday period is over, sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. in any business, excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices,\" mr shipside said.\"the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling, even in the current market.\" overall, asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their july peaks as the equivalent of â£6,500 has been cut from an average property. a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. \"what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole,\" cml director general michael coogan said. \"it's a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market,\" investec economist philip shaw said. \"however, the figures do suggest only a modest weakening, and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time, though a collapse is still unlikely.\"\n",

      "fresh hope after argentine crisisthree years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope.the country's economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year, a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11%. the unemployment rate is improving, too: it is set to slip below 13% by the end of the year, down from 20% in may 2002. true, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. even the international monetary fund (imf) admits this. \"the argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy,\" thomas dawson, an imf director, said earlier this month.argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government's decisions. pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country's massive debts. in response, angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police. two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month. argentina was on the brink of collapse. the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso's decade-long peg to the us dollar in february 2002. the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people's life savings disappear. scathes of companies went bust. \"three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis,\" said entrepreneur drayton valentine. it really was dire.but since then, the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically, in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil. \"agriculture and tourism are helping,\" said entrepreneur drayton valentine.mr valentine, who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina, was fortunate: at the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. but now he is using his money to help with the start-up a trading company. he explained that initially, his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states. then, he would like to diversify to other areas, depending on the market. \"locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now,\" he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening.but not all that shines is gold. argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. president nestor kirchner's administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors, but with the debts' nominal value standing at around $100bn it is not proving easy. debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate. argentina's current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed, according to the creditors. understandably, they want more and until they do, both they and others are loath to continue lending. for president kirchner, this proves a hopeless challenge. real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay, observed jack boorman, adviser to imf's managing director, rodrigo rato. \"everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached,\" he said. \"the cost is enormous, and continues to be paid, and will not be reversed by any restructuring.\"with the international negotiations being troubled, it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well.this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits. \"the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina, \" said carlos baez silva, president of aara, an association that represents bank account and bond holders. few people have recovered more than about half their savings, mr baez silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe. \"a lot of them invested in good faith,\" he said. \"the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments.\" the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country's legal system. on occasion, the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents, he says, insisting that the system cannot be trusted. \"people have to deposit their money in the banks, not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses.\" mr valentine, who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina, agreed. \"if i have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem, but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank\".\n",

      "putin backs state grab for yukosrussia's president has defended the purchase of yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.vladimir putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met. rosneft bought 100% of baikal finance group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of russia's booming oil industry. rosneft will now control about 16% of russia's total crude oil output. yukos share jumped in moscow, climbing as much as 50% before being suspended.rosneft is already in the process of merging with gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, a move that will see gazprom return to majority state-ownership.baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant yukos's main production division at a forced auction on sunday. \"everything was done by market methods,\" mr putin said at his year-end press conference in moscow. shedding some light on the kremlin's motivation, mr putin referred to a period of so-called \"cowboy capitalism\" that followed the collapse of the soviet union.he said privatisations carried out in the early 1990s had involved trickery, including law breaking, by people seeking to acquire valuable state property. \"now the state, using market methods, is safeguarding its interests. i think this is quite normal,\" the russian president said. a rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a \"balanced, national energy corporation.\"the latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed yukos, one of russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse. the russian government put yukos's yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn (â£14bn) bill for back taxes and fines.analysts say that yukos's legal attempts to block the auction by filing for bankruptcy protection in the us are probably what caused this week's cloak-and-dagger dealings. gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a us court injunction. by selling the yukos unit to little-known baikal and then to rosneft, russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said. \"you cannot sue the russian government,\" said eric kraus, a strategist at moscow's sovlink securities. \"the russian government has sovereign immunity.\" \"the government is renationalising yuganskneftegas.\"even so, analysts reckon that the saga still has a long way to go. the rosneft announcement came just hours after yukos accused gazprom of illegally taking part in sunday's auction. it has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn. the claim was made at the latest hearing in the us bankruptcy court in houston, texas, where yukos, had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. if found in contempt of the us court order blocking the auction, gazprom could face having foreign assets seized. yukos' lawyers had also been expected to try to have baikal's assets frozen. lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because yukos - with an office in houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of us law which has worldwide jurisdiction. further muddying the waters is a merger between rosneft and gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned.\n",

most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet. the international monetary fund (imf) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.\"the imf stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need,\" said managing director rodrigo rato. only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support, while indonesia, the quake's epicentre, has recently graduated from imf assistance. it is up to governments to decide if they want imf help. other agencies, such as the asian development bank, have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed. there is no underestimating the size of the problem, however. the united nations' emergency relief coordinator, jan egeland, said that \"this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas... so many vulnerable communities. \"many people will have [had] their livelihoods, their whole future destroyed in a few seconds.\" he warned that \"the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself\" because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water.insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage, but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the us earlier this year.\"the region that's affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is\", said serge troeber, deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re, the world's second biggest reinsurance firm. \"i should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us,\" he said. munich re, the world's biggest reinsurer, said: \"this is primarily a human tragedy. it is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be.\" allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability. however, a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region, rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there.the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies told the reuters news agency that it was seeking $6.5m for emergency aid.\"the biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhoea,\" the aid agency was quoted as saying. the european union has said it will deliver 3m euros (â£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid, according to the wall street journal. the eu's humanitarian aid commissioner, louis michel, was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid \"in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster\". other countries also are reported to have pledged cash, while the us state department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region. getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend's events.many of the worst-hit areas, such as sri lanka, thailand's phuket island and the maldives, are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies.december and january are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump. growth has been rapid in southeast asia, with the world tourism organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004. in southern asia that expansion is 23%. \"india continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country,\" the wto said. \"arrivals to other destinations such as... maldives and sri lanka also thrived.\" in thailand, tourism accounts for about 6% of the country's annual gross domestic product, or about $8bn. in singapore the figure is close to 5%. tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency. in the short-term, however, travel companies are cancelling flights and trips. that has hit shares across asia and europe, with investors saying that earnings and economic growth are likely to slow.\n",

      "deutsche attacks yukos casegerman investment bank deutsche bank has challenged the right of yukos to claim bankruptcy protection in the us.in a court filing on tuesday, it said the russian oil giant has few texas ties beyond bank accounts and a texas-based finance chief. deutsche bank claimed yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. it had wanted to help fund gazprom's plans for a $10bn (â£5.18bn) bid for yukos unit yuganskneftegas.deutsche bank would have earned large fees from the deal, which could not be carried out because us chapter 11 bankruptcy rules made the kremlin's auction of yuganskneftegas on 19 december illegal under us law.but the us bankruptcy court judge in texas granted yukos an injunction that barred gazprom and its lenders from taking part. yuganskneftegas will ultimately end up with gazprom. the winning bidder at the auction was a previously unknown firm, baikal finance group, which was snapped up days later by rosneft, a russian oil firm that is in the process of merging with gazprom. the effect of these transactions is to renationalise yuganskneftegas. deutsche bank contends yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 december auction of its top unit by the russian government, which was in a tax dispute with yukos.\"this blatant attempt to artificially manufacture a basis for jurisdiction constitutes cause to dismiss this case,\" deutsche bank said in its court filing. mike lake, a spokesman for yukos' lawyers, said on tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. yukos is confident of its right to us bankruptcy protection, and \"we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again,\" he said. yukos has said it intends to seek $20bn in damages from the buyer of yuganskneftegas once the sale finally goes through. in its filing, deutsche bank said houston was \"a jurisdiction in which yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations.\"it also said the us bankruptcy court should not become involved in \"a tax dispute between the federation and one of its corporate citizens\". it suggested the european court or an international arbitration tribunal were more appropriate jurisdictions for the legal fight between russia and yukos. the next hearing in the bankruptcy is expected on 6 january. analysts believe the tax dispute between the russian government and yukos is partly driven by russian president vladimir putin's hostility hostility to the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khordokovsky. mr khodorkovsky is in jail, and on trial for fraud and tax evasion.\n",

      "indian oil firm eyes yukos assetsindia's biggest oil exploration firm, oil & natural gas corp (ongc), says it is in talks to buy the former assets of troubled russian crude producer yukos.\"we are in touch with the concerned russian entities about the yukos assets and other opportunities in russia,\" said ongc chairman subir raha. local press had reported that ongc was looking to buy 15% of yukos' former key oil production unit for $2bn (â£1bn). yukos is being broken up by russian authorities to pay a massive tax bill.it was forced to sell its key production unit yuganskneftegas (yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines.state-owned rosneft now owns yugansk and russia has said it will turn the oil producer into a stand-alone firm. indian oil minister mani shankar aiyar discussed ongc's plans during a trip to moscow last year, and the topic came up again during russian president vladimir putin's recent visit to new delhi. \"it would make great sense for us to build on that,\" said mr aiyar. india's oil production has stagnated over recent years, and it is having to look abroad to secure future supplies. india imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. at the same time, india's economy is booming and the country's thirst for oil is so strong that it has helped pushed up the price of crude worldwide.india produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. consumption, meanwhile, has jumped to 2.4 million bpd, compared with 474,000 bpd in 1973.\"for countries to develop, they have to have access to energy,\" said john westwood, managing director of oil industry analysts douglas-westwood. india is a \"dramatically growing economy that must have access to oil\". by buying into yugansk, ongc would be able to reduce its dependence on gulf states for oil imports, mr westwood explained, especially as the chances of finding and exploiting resources within india are slim. \"we forecast that indian production will go into significant decline,\" mr westwood said. \"by 2020, production may only be at half of today's levels.\" ongc, which is majority-owned by the indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including vietnam, sudan and russia. the company is a partner with rosneft in the sakhalin-1 oil field off russia's siberian coast.ongc is, however, not the only firm interested in yugansk.chinese crude company china national petroleum has also been mentioned as a possible investor, while on thursday, italy refused to rule out an interest. ongc's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees. the dispute is partly driven by president putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-yukos boss mikhail khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. yukos has been battling the russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us. analysts have questioned how long it can continue to survive without yugansk. on thursday, a us court said it will hear arguments for yukos' bankruptcy claim to be thrown out on 16 february. should that happen, yukos will have little chance of clawing back its assets, analysts said.\n",

      "uk bank seals south korean dealuk-based bank standard chartered said it would spend $3.3bn (â£1.8bn) to buy one of south korea's main retail banks.standard chartered said acquiring korea first bank (kfb) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in asia's third largest economy. its shares fell nearly 3% in london as the bank raised funds for the deal by selling new stocks worth â£1bn ($1.8bn), equal to 10% of its share capital. standard chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from kfb.the south korean bank will also make up 22% of the group's total assets. the move, a year after citigroup beat standard chartered to buy koram bank, would be the south korean financial sector's biggest foreign takeover. this time around, standard chartered is thought to have beaten hsbc to the deal. kfb is south korea's seventh largest bank, with 3 million retail customers, 6% of the country's banking market and an extensive branch network.the country's banking market is three times the size of hong kong's with annual revenues of $44bn. standard chartered has its headquarters in london but does two thirds of its business in asia, and much of the rest in africa. \"we're comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won,\" said standard chartered chief executive mervyn davies at a london press conference. standard chartered said kfb was a \"well-managed, conservatively run bank with a highly skilled workforce\" and represented a \"significant acquisition in a growth market\". in london, standard chartered's sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down, and contributing to the ftse 100's 0.3% decline. standard chartered's shares were 28 pence lower at 925p by midday. some analysts also queried whether standard chartered had overpaid for kfb. the deal, which requires regulatory approval, is expected to be completed by april 2005 and to be earnings accretive in 2006, standard chartered said.rival banking giant hsbc, which is based in london and hong kong, was also in the running. standard chartered is believed to have gained the initiative by putting together a bid during the christmas break. \"they were able to move so quickly it caught hsbc by surprise,\" the financial times newspaper quoted an insider in the talks as saying. hsbc will now have to wait for the next south korean bank in line to be sold off - thought likely to be korea exchange bank, also currently in the hands of a us group. standard chartered said it was buying 100% of kfb, an agreement that would bring an end to the bank's complex dual ownership. the south korean government owns 51.4% of kfb, while the remaining shareholding, and operational control, are in the hands of us private equity group newbridge capital. newbridge bought its stake during the government's nationalisation of several banks in the wake of the 1997 asia-wide currency crisis which crippled south korea's financial institutions.south korea's economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. although often thought of an export-driven economy, south korea's service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so. services now make up roughly 40% of the economy, and consumer spending and retail banking have become increasingly important. in the aftermath of the asian financial crisis, the government encouraged the growth of consumer credit. bad loan problems followed; lg card, the country's biggest credit card provider, has been struggling to avoid bankruptcy for months, for instance. but analysts believe south korea's financial services industry is still in its infancy, offering plenty of scope for new products. standard chartered sees \"the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products\". since 1999, kfb has been restructured from a wholesale bank into a retail bank focused on mortgage lending, which makes up 45% of its loans.\n",

      "iran budget seeks state sell-offsiran's president, mohammad khatami, has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30% but loosen the islamic republic's dependence on oil.the budget for the fiscal year starting on 21 march calls for the sell-off of 20% of the state's corporate holdings. mr khatami's second term as president ends on 1 august, making this his last budget. but opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. elections in may 2004 ousted many of mr khatami's supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. the ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by turkish companies, which hardliners accused of doing business with israel. it came not long after the expediency council - iran's ultimate decision-maker - blessed mr khatami's policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of mr khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues.in an address to the majlis, mr khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year. he said he wanted to increase the 2005-6 budget to 1,546 trillion rials ($175.6bn; â£93.6bn) from the previous year's 1,070 trillion. within that figure, taxation would rise to $14.3bn, a rise of over 40% from what is expected from the current year. in contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to march 2005. \"current government expenditure should come from tax revenues,\" mr khatami said. \"oil revenues should be used for productive investment.\" mr khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre.\n",
      "ec calls truce in deficit battlethe european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.the move came after france and germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the eu cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years. but, the ec did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. under eu rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%. france and germany will breach that this year. it will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the european union's stability and growth pact rules.the eurozone's two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in november 2003 when they persuaded fellow eu members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.the commission then took the pair to the european court of human justice - which ruled eu countries could not put the pact \"in abeyance\", and confirmed the ec's right to launch \"excessive debt procedures\". after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%. \"the commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005,\" it said in a statement. the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year, while france's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. the forecasts are based on ec predictions of gdp growth of 1.5% in germany next year and 2.2% in france.berlin welcomed the decision, with finance minister hans eichel saying it showed that the ec recognised germany's fiscal policy was \"on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions\". however paris was more subdued, with finance minister herve gaymard telling parliament: \"we must continue along this path of saving money.\" however, the move still had its critics, with the european people's party (epp) attacking the ec for backing down from punitive action. \"the commission is buckling under the pressure from germany and france, \" epp spokesman alexander radwan said. \"the scary fact is that budget sinners, despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit, do not have to fear any sanctions.\" despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies, it refused to comment on similar action against greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said that it was a matter for next week.\n",

      "minister hits out at yukos salerussia's renationalisation of its energy industry needs to be reversed, a senior government figure has warned.economy minister german gref told the kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was \"unjustified\". his comments follow the sale of much of oil giant yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership. on 28 december, another senior economic adviser called the sale \"the swindle of the century\". yuganskneftegaz, the unit which produced 60% of yukos' output, had been seized and sold in december for less than $10bn to a previously unknown firm called baikal.baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant gazprom. \"we used to see street hustlers do this kind of thing,\" andrei illarionov - then economic adviser to president vladimir putin - told a press conference. \"now officials are doing it.\" within days, he was stripped of most of his responsibilities.mr gref, a well-known opponent of nationalisation in competitive parts of the market, was keen to distance himself from mr iliaronov's comments. the privatisation of companies such as yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. but he stressed that the government needed to get out of oil. \"i think that rosneft and yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized,\" he said.\"today our government is ineffective and state companies, as a result, are for the overwhelming part ineffective as well.\" and he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like yukos - a technique now being applied by the kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. \"if we follow that logic, we should nationalise all businesses,\" he said. many large russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes.mr gref also poured cold water on president putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. the assault on yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. \"the task is not simply to double gdp; instead it is to use gdp to qualitatively improve people's lives,\" mr gref told kommersant. \"we don't need simply to increase gdp, but to improve its structure.\" instead of focusing on headline growth figures, russia needed to focus on better institutions, such as a more efficient - and less corrupt - court system.\n",
      "chinese exports rise 25% in 2004exports from china leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth.the spurt put china's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. it may also increase pressure on china to relax the peg joining its currency, the yuan, with the weakening dollar. the figures released by the ministry of commerce come as china's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. state administration of taxation head xie xuren said a tightening of controls on tax evasion had combined with the rapid expansion to produce a 25.7% rise in tax revenues to 2.572 trillion yuan ($311bn; â£165bn).according to the ministry of commerce, china's exports totalled $63.8bn in december, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn. with imports rising a similar amount, the deficit rose to $43.4bn. the increased tax take comes despite healthy tax rebates for many exporters totalling 420bn yuan in 2004, according to mr xie. china's exporting success has made the trade deficit of the united states soar even further and made trade with china a sensitive political issue in washington. the peg keeping the yuan around 8.30 to the dollar is often blamed by us lawmakers for job losses at home. a us report issued on tuesday on behalf of a congressionally-mandated panel said almost 1.5 million posts disappeared between 1989 and 2003. the pace accelerated in the final three years of the period, said the report for the us-china economic and security review commission, moving out of labour-intensive industries and into more hi-tech sectors. the us's overall trade deficit with china was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004.\n",
      "karachi stocks hit historic highthe karachi stock exchange (kse) has recorded its largest single day gain, surging 3.5% to a new high.the index rose 225.79 points in four hours of furious trading, with many investors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic boom. the kse index closed at 6709.93 - an overall gain of nearly 400 points in the first two trading days of the week. energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% rise since monday morning.in 2002, the kse was the world's best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%.pakistani investors are expecting the kse to repeat, if not improve on, its 2002 performance. jubilant investors danced on the streets as the market closed for the day on tuesday, confident that the boom will continue at least until the public holiday on 22 january. others, however, who had stayed out fearing an imminent collapse because of prices overheating, continued to warn that the \"bubble may burst any time\". \"that's rubbish,\" kse chairman yaseen lakhani told the bbc news website. \"whenever the market reflects pakistan's true economic reality, it is described as a bubble.\" mr lakhani feels that the market has risen on the basis of solid economic growth and its current level rests on sound foundations.market analysts are inclined to agree with mr lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the kse's performance. analysts argue that a steady improvement in pakistan's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. standard & poor's upgraded pakistan a few weeks ago. there are indications of yet another upgrade by the end of february.then, say analysts, there is corporate profitability in the current fiscal year, which has gone up by 27% from last year. \"coupled with the 7% gdp growth expected by june this year, i am least surprised at the market's performance,\" says mr lakhani. one leading karachi broker said the real reasons may be political. \"if you file a $1.3 trillion case against saudi money after 9/11, arab money will not go to the us any more.\" a lot of arab money, he says, has already gone to malaysia and indonesia. pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in pakistan, draw some of the arab money to the kse.locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market's advantage.an anti-musharraf campaign threatened by the mma, a countrywide alliance of religious parties, has fizzled out. the release of asif zardari, former prime minister benazir bhutto's husband, has eased political tensions between the military-backed government and the opposition pakistan people's party. most importantly, say analysts, the failure of talks between india and pakistan on the baglihar dam in indian-administered kashmir has not automatically led to heightened tensions. this, they say, indicates that neither country is interested in raising the temperature at this stage, irrespective of the state of their disagreements. the market is abuzz with speculation that substantial investment may now start to flow in from the us, a country seen locally as deeply interested in defusing tensions between the south asian neighbours. \"you can call it a peace dividend,\" smiles one broker. \"let us see how long one can reap its benefits.\"\n",

      "us prepares for hybrid onslaughtsales of hybrid cars in the us are set to double in 2005, research suggests.research group jd power estimates sales will hit 200,000 in 2005, despite higher prices and customer scepticism. carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (suvs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the us car market. hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. several jurisdictions, notably the state of california, mandate low emissions for new cars. equally, the rise in oil prices over the past year has sparked hopes that consumers may be tempted by potential savings of a few hundred dollars a year on fuel.at the detroit motor show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. toyota has led the market to date with the prius, popularised by a number of celebrities keen to burnish their \"green\" credentials. in april it will launch a hybrid version of its highlander suv, with an suv from its luxury lexus marque due later in the year.honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. ford, which has sold 4,000 of its first hybrid since its launch in august, is bringing a hybrid suv - the mariner - to market a year ahead of schedule, with plans for three more models by 2008. gm has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept suvs in detroit. even sports car maker porsche may join the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its cayenne suv.others remain more sceptical. nissan has bought toyota's hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. \"we want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology,\" nissan chief executive carlos ghosn said. \"we will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market.\" volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead. and some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction. \"the average consumers aren't willing to pay that premium for a car they won't drive more than six years,\" said anthony pratt from jd power.\n",

      "uk interest rates held at 4.75%the bank of england has left interest rates on hold again at 4.75%, in a widely-predicted move.rates went up five times from november 2003 - as the bank sought to cool the housing market and consumer debt - but have remained unchanged since august. recent data has indicated a slowdown in manufacturing and consumer spending, as well as in mortgage approvals. and retail sales disappointed over christmas, with analysts putting the drop down to less consumer confidence.rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the british retail consortium. the brc said britain's retailers had endured their worst christmas in a decade.\"today's no change decision is correct,\" said david frost, director general of the british chambers of commerce (bcc). \"but, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the mpc should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. \"dismal reports from the retail trade about christmas sales are worrying, if they indicate a more general weakening in consumer spending.\"mr frost added: \"the housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. \"it is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably.\" cbi chief economist ian mccafferty said the economy had \"slowed in recent months in response to rate rises\" but that it was difficult to gauge from the christmas period the likely pace of activity through the summer. \"the bank is having to juggle the emergence of inflationary pressures, driven by a tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices, against the risk of an over-abrupt slowdown in consumer activity,\" he said. \"interest rates are likely to remain on hold for some time.\"on thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the office for national (ons) statistics revealed british manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in november - for the fifth month in the past six. the ons said manufacturing output dropped 0.1% in november, matching a similar unrevised fall in october and confounding economists' expectations of a 0.3% rise. manufacturers' organisation, the eef, said it expected the hold in interest rates to continue in the near future. it also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.\"so far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing,\" said eef chief economist, steve radley. \"however, should the business outlook start to deteriorate, the bank should stand ready to cut rates.\" some economists have predicted rates will drop later in the year, although others feel the bank may still think there is a need for a rise to 5% before that happens. the bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.\n",
      "german economy reboundsgermany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.gross domestic product (gdp) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. the economy contracted in 2003. foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. the european central bank (ecb) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on thursday. it is the nineteenth month in a row that the ecb has not moved borrowing costs. economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.\"during 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,\" said stefan schilbe, analyst at hsbc trinkaus & burkhardt. \"if exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005.\" many german consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. major companies including volkswagen, daimlerchrysler and siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. they have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.\n",
      "us trade deficit widens sharplythe gap between us exports and imports has widened to more than $60bn (â£31.7bn), an all-time record.figures from the commerce department for november showed exports down 2.3% to $95.6bn, while imports grew 1.3% to $155.8bn on rising consumer demand. part of the expanding deficit came from high prices for oil imports. but the numbers suggested the sliding dollar - which makes exports less expensive - has had little impact, and could indicate slowing economic growth.the trade deficit - far bigger than the $54bn widely expected on wall street - prompted a rapid response from the currency markets.by 1650 gmt, the dollar was trading against the euro at $1.3280, almost a cent and a half weaker than before the announcement. against the pound, the dollar was down about 0.7% at $1,8923. \"the dollar's fall has been sudden, violent and appropriate given this number,\" said brian taylor of wells fargo in minneapolis. \"recent exchange rate movements certainly haven't had any impact yet.\" treasury secretary john snow put a brave face on the news, saying it was a sign of strong economic expansion. \"the economy is growing at such a fast rate that it is generating lots of disposable income... some of which is used to buy goods from our trading partners.\"although the white house officially still backs the us's traditional \"strong dollar\" policy, it has tacitly indicated that it would be happy if the slide continued. the dollar has fallen by 50% against the euro - as well as by 30% against the yen - in the past three years. the main catalyst, most economists accept, is the large budget deficit on the one hand, and the current account deficit - the difference between the flow of money in and out of the us - on the other. the trade deficit is a large part of the latter. in november, the fall in exports was largely due to a decline in sales of industrial supplies and materials such as chemicals, as well as of cars, consumer goods and food. one small bright spot for us policy-makers was a slight decline in the deficit with china, often blamed for job losses and other economic woes. although china's overall trade surplus is expanding, according to chinese government figures, the commerce department revealed the us's deficit with china was $19.6bn in november, down from $19.7bn the month before. but the deficit with japan was at its worst in more than four years.\n",

      "'golden economic period' to endten years of \"golden\" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, city consultancy deloitte has warned.the uk economy could suffer a backlash from the slowdown in the housing market, triggering a fall in consumer spending and a rise in unemployment. deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below chancellor gordon brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%. it also believes that interest rates will fall to 4% by the end of the year.in its quarterly economic review, deloitte said the uk economy had enjoyed a \"golden period\" during the past decade with unemployment falling to a near 30 year low and inflation at its lowest since the 1960s.but it warned that this growth had been achieved at the expense of creating major \"imbalances\" in the economy. deloitte's chief economic advisor roger bootle said: \"the biggest hit of all is set to come from the housing market which has already embarked on a major slowdown. \"whereas the main driver of the economy in recent years has been robust household spending growth, this is likely to suffer as the housing market slowdown gathers pace.\"economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, deloitte believes. gordon brown will need to raise about $10bn a year in order to sustain the public finances in the short term, the firm claims. this will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%. however, deloitte stressed that the slowdown was unlikely to have any major impact on retail prices while it expected the bank of england to respond quickly to signs of the economy faltering. it expects a series of \"aggressive\" interest rate cuts over the next two years, with the cost of borrowing falling from its current 4.75% mark to 3.5% by the end of 2006. \"although 2005 may not be the year when things go completely wrong, it will probably mark the start of a more difficult period for the uk economy,\" mr bootle.\n",

      "tsunami slows sri lanka's growthsri lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (â£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.president kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. meanwhile, the international monetary fund (imf) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from sri lanka's economic growth this year. it estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.separately, the international labour organisation (ilo) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in sri lanka and indonesia alone. it called for action to create jobs. president kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of hambantota. she was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with buddhist, hindu, muslim and christian clergy.prime minister mahinda rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. mrs kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be \"the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation\". \"we are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. instead we have been squabbling, fighting,\" she added. norway's peace negotiator erik solheim is due to arrive on wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the tamil tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. reconstruction efforts in eastern sri lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.the imf said that the sri lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. \"the broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,\" the imf said. growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. \"the fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,\" the report said. the ilo estimated that 400,000 sri lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. although major exports have not suffered, the imf expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. foreign exchange reserves may become strained as \"sri lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level\" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. last week, the imf approved sri lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.\n",
      "china suspends 26 power projectschina has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the three gorges dam, on environmental grounds.the move is a surprising one because china is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. the state environmental protection agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper yangtze river. \"construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,\" said sepa vice-director pan yue, in a statement on the agency's website.some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in fujian. the bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. the stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. however, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. the government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. in 2004, china increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (mw). the biggest single project to be halted was the xiluodi dam project, designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity. it is being built on the jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn three gorges dam project on the central yangtze - an underground 4,200 mw power plant and a 100 mw plant.the three gorges dam has proved controversial in china - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. it has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. the damming of the upper yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in china. in april 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby nu river, which is part of a united nations world heritage site, the three parallel rivers site which covers the yangtze, mekong and nu (also known as the salween), according to the uk-published china review. that move reportedly followed a protest from the thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by chinese journalists. china's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.\n",

      "world leaders gather to face uncertaintymore than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). for five days, they will discuss issues ranging from china's economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos.the organisers of the brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit. however, many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well. \"global warming\" features particularly high. wef participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. davos itself is in deep frost. the snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20c and less.ultimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme. \"taking responsibility for tough choices\" is this year's official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. one thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with iran, iraq and china are set to dominate discussions. pointedly, only one senior official from president bush's new administration is scheduled to attend. the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos.ukraine's new president, viktor yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.the european union's top leaders, among them german chancellor gerhard schroeder and european commission president manuel barosso, will be here too. mr blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by french president jacques chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a \"special message\" two hours before mr blair speaks. the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader, mahmoud abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes shimon peres. davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal. mr blair's appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the uk claim it is a calculated snub against political rival chancellor gordon brown, who was supposed to lead the uk government delegation.microsoft founder bill gates, the world's richest man and a regular at davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria, mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. on tuesday, mr gates pledged $750m (â£400m) of his own money to support the cause. mr gates' company, software giant microsoft, also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux, which threaten microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops. mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazil's president lula da silva. the brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from microsoft to linux. at davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.\n",
      "us budget deficit to reach $368bnthe us budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (â£197bn) this year, officials said on tuesday.the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. past congressional budget office (cbo) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. in recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. in november, the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. the cbo says it envisages a further \"orderly\" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. but the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth.the budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. however, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan. one of president george w bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies. on tuesday, the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations.\n",

      "brazil jobless rate hits new lowbrazil's unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in three years in december, according to the government.the brazilian institute for geography and statistics (ibge) said it fell to 9.6% in december from 10.6% in november and 10.9% in december 2003. ibge also said that average monthly salaries grew 1.9% in december 2004 from december 2003. however, average monthly wages fell 1.8% in december to 895.4 reais ($332; â£179.3) from november. tuesday's figures represent the first time that the unemployment rate has fallen to a single digit since new measurement rules were introduced in 2001. the unemployment rate has been falling gradually since april 2004 when it reached a peak of 13.1%. the jobless rate average for the whole of 2004 was 11.5%, down from 12.3% in 2003, the ibge said.this improvement can be attributed to the country's strong economic growth, with the economy registering growth of 5.2% in 2004, the government said. the economy is expected to grow by about 4% this year. president luiz inacio lula da silva promised to reduce unemployment when he was elected two years ago. nevertheless, some analysts say that unemployment could increase in the next months. \"the data is favourable, but a lot of jobs are temporary for the (christmas) holiday season, so we may see slightly higher joblessness in january and february,\" julio hegedus, chief economist with lopes filho & associates consultancy in rio de janeir, told reuters news agency. despite his leftist background, president lula has pursued a surprisingly conservative economic policy, arguing that in order to meet its social promises, the government needs to first reach a sustained economic growth. the unemployment rate is measured in the six main metropolitan areas of brazil (sao paolo, rio de janeiro, belo horizonte, recife, salvador and porto alegre), where most of the population is concentrated.\n",
      "indonesia 'declines debt freeze'indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors, economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said.indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the paris club about $48bn (â£25.5bn). mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. this aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. most of this 'normal aid' would be used to finance the country's budget deficit. the indonesian economics minister explained that the money - $1.2bn in grants and $500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of aceh province, which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 december. nevertheless, one of mr bakrie's deputies, mahendra siregar, told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. \"what is true is that we are still discussing... the paris club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. that's how far we are at this stage,\" said mr siregar.the 19 member countries of the paris club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami. indonesia, sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. thailand and india have however declined the offer, with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. putting off payments may lower a country's rating among financial organisations, making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future, analysts said. separately, the indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. welfare minister alwi shihab told ap news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations.\n",

      "china continues rapid growthchina's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%.the news may mean more limits on investment and lending as beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. china has sucked in raw materials and energy to feed its expansion, which could have knock-on effects on the rest of the world if it overheats. but officials pointed out that industrial growth had slowed, with services providing much of the impetus. growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year.still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation. and overall investment in fixed assets was still high, up 21.3% from the previous year - although some way off the peak of 43% seen in the first quarter of 2004. the result could be higher interest rates. china raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in october 2004.despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. \"there is no sign of a slowdown in 2005,\" said tim congdon, economist at ing barings.china's economy is not only gathering speed thanks to domestic demand, but also from soaring sales overseas. figures released earlier this year showed exports at a six-year high in 2004, up 35%. part of the impetus comes from the relative cheapness of the yuan, china's currency. the government keeps it pegged close to a rate of 8.28 to the us dollar, - much to the chagrin of many us lawmakers who blame china for lost jobs and competitiveness. despite urging to ease the peg, officials insist they are a long way from ready to make a shift to a more market-set rate. \"we need a good and feasible plan and formulating such a plan also needs time,\" national bureau of statistics chief li deshui told reuters. \"those who hope to make a fortune by speculating on a renminbi revaluation will not succeed in making a profit.\"\n",
      "sec to rethink post-enron rulesthe us stock market watchdog's chairman has said he is willing to soften tough new us corporate governance rules to ease the burden on foreign firms.in a speech at the london school of economics, william donaldson promised \"several initiatives\". european firms have protested that us laws introduced after the enron scandal make wall street listings too costly. the us regulator said foreign firms may get extra time to comply with a key clause in the sarbanes-oxley act.the act comes into force in mid-2005. it obliges all firms with us stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts.firms that break the new law could face huge fines, while senior executives risk jail terms of up to 20 years. mr donaldson said that although the act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the securities and exchange commission (sec) would \"continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements\". there are few, if any, who disagree with the intentions of the act, which obliges chief executives to sign a statement taking responsibility for the accuracy of the accounts. but european firms with secondary listings in new york have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. the act also applies to firms with more than 300 us shareholders, a situation many firms without us listings could find themselves in.the 300-shareholder threshold has drawn anger as it effectively blocks the most obvious remedy, a delisting. mr donaldson said the sec would \"consider whether there should be a new approach to the deregistration process\" for foreign firms unwilling to meet us requirements.\"we should seek a solution that will preserve investor protections\" without turning the us market into \"one with no exit\", he said. he revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the act's least popular measure - section 404 - for foreign firms. seen as particularly costly to implement, section 404 obliges chief executives to take responsibility for the firm's internal controls by signing a compliance statement in the annual accounts. the sec has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including us ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (â£374m).a delegation of european firms visited the sec in december to press for change, the financial times reported.it was led by digby jones, director general of the uk's confederation of british industry (cbi) and included representatives of basf, siemens and cadbury schweppes. compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of us listings. air china picked the london stock exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (â£558m) stock market debut last month. there are also rumours that two chinese state-run banks - china construction bank and bank of china - have abandoned plans for multi-billion dollar listings in new york later this year. instead, the cost of sarbanes-oxley has persuaded them to stick to a single listing in hong kong, according to press reports in china.\n",
      "bbc poll indicates economic gloomcitizens in a majority of nations surveyed in a bbc world service poll believe the world economy is worsening.most respondents also said their national economy was getting worse. but when asked about their own family's financial outlook, a majority in 14 countries said they were positive about the future. almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the asian tsunami disaster. the poll found that a majority or plurality of people in 13 countries believed the economy was going downhill, compared with respondents in nine countries who believed it was improving. those surveyed in three countries were split. in percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving. similarly, 48% were pessimistic about their national economy, while 41% were optimistic. and 47% saw their family's economic conditions improving, as against 36% who said they were getting worse.the poll of 22,953 people was conducted by the international polling firm globescan, together with the program on international policy attitudes (pipa) at the university of maryland. \"while the world economy has picked up from difficult times just a few years ago, people seem to not have fully absorbed this development, though they are personally experiencing its effects,\" said pipa director steven kull. \"people around the world are saying: 'i'm ok, but the world isn't'.\" there may be a perception that war, terrorism and religious and political divisions are making the world a worse place, even though that has not so far been reflected in global economic performance, says the bbc's elizabeth blunt.the countries where people were most optimistic, both for the world and for their own families, were two fast-growing developing economies, china and india, followed by indonesia. china has seen two decades of blistering economic growth, which has led to wealth creation on a huge scale, says the bbc's louisa lim in beijing. but the results also may reflect the untrammelled confidence of people who are subject to endless government propaganda about their country's rosy economic future, our correspondent says. south korea was the most pessimistic, while respondents in italy and mexico were also quite gloomy. the bbc's david willey in rome says one reason for that result is the changeover from the lira to the euro in 2001, which is widely viewed as the biggest reason why their wages and salaries are worth less than they used to be. the philippines was among the most upbeat countries on prospects for respondents' families, but one of the most pessimistic about the world economy. pipa conducted the poll from 15 november 2004 to 3 january 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews. the interviews took place between 15 november 2004 and 5 january 2005. the margin of error is between 2.5 and 4 points, depending on the country. in eight of the countries, the sample was limited to major metropolitan areas.\n",

      "water firm suez in argentina rowa conflict between the argentine state and water firm aguas argentinas, controlled by france's suez, is casting doubt on the firm's future.the firm, which serves the province of buenos aires, wants a tariff rise of 60% to fund water-supply improvements. the government has rejected the 60% rise and wants aguas argentinas to make an annual investment of 400m pesos ($136m; â£72.3m) in improvements. planning minister julio de vido has offered state help but not for \"free\".mr de vido said that the argentine state would not make a contribution \"in the form of a subsidy\".he has said a contribution could be made in return for a seat on the company's board. he added that the government is in discussions with aguas argentinas about what role it might take in the event that a state contribution is agreed. however, aguas argentinas told the argentine newspaper clarin it would not accept any change to its legal structure and, in practice, this rules out state participation on its board. the planning minister didn't rule out the possibility of cancelling aguas argentinas water concession. yet he added that he didn't like to do \"futurology\". but last week, argentine economic minister, roberto lavagna, told the french media in paris that the government was considering allowing a 16% increase in tariffs and the possibility of a state contribution to aguas argentinas infrastructure investments. speaking in buenos aires, mr de vido later denied the possibility of any tariff increase and insisted that the annual investment in water infrastructure was at the centre of the discussions. he added that in the coming weeks the future of aguas argentinas would be decided. suez owns 40% of aguas argentinas (39.9%), while spain's aguas de barcelona is its second biggest shareholder with 25.01%. recently, suez lost a water concession in bolivia after mass protests in the city of el alto (the poorest in the country), with citizens complaining of unfair water charges. this forced the government to cancel the contract.in argentina, suez's subsidiary, which has been fined for cutting the supply of water during a recent heat wave and allegedly failing to keep up investment to meet the demand for water, has maintained a tense relationship with the argentine government. during the last financial crisis in argentina, the firm sued the state alleging that converting its tariffs from us dollars to pesos, and then freezing them during devaluation, had affected the company and made it difficult for it to meet its contractual obligations. when president nestor kirchner of argentina arrived in power he began to negotiate a solution to the disagreements with international utilities operating in argentina. but he has rejected any tariff increases, alleging this will impoverish citizens further. he has also asked for more investments to meet the growing demand for water. on may 2004, aguas argentinas and the government signed an agreement to renegotiate its buenos aires water-concession contract. the firm agreed to invest 242m pesos. the issue has attracted european interest. last week in paris, president kirchner discussed this problem and other issues with french president jacques chirac. the argentine government is also under pressure from european union countries and the international monetary fund (imf) to raise utilities tariffs, because most of the utilities operating in argentina are european.\n",

      "uk economy ends year with spurtthe uk economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the office for national statistics (ons).the figure is in line with treasury and bank of england forecasts. the ons says gross domestic product (gdp) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 december, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. the rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst christmas for retailers in decades.the annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion. \"on the basis of the latest information the uk has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth,\" said paul boateng, chief secretary to the treasury in a statement.the ons said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the uk economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter. the strong services figure was welcomed by analysts, given lacklustre retail sales in december and across the christmas holiday period. \"the fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and i am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,\" said ross walker, uk economist at rbs financial markets.however, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. however the ons would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. but steve radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation eef, said: \"these figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. \"whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year, 'recession' is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise.\" the ons said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.simon rubinsohn, chief economist at gerrard, said: \"this outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the uk economy.\" and he said the gdp figures may help to \"push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve\". \"the suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. this is consistent with our own thinking,\" said mr rubinsohn. the bank of england's nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at 4.75%, minutes of the meeting showed on wednesday.\n",

      "dvd review: spider-man 2it's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good. but spider-man 2 breaks that rule in two.it's not fantastically deep but you get quickly drawn into the tale of spidey versus doc ock and more so into the fate of poor peter parker. gigantic action set pieces seamlessly work with more brooding personal torment and it all looks stunning. a few effects look false but tobey maguire, kirsten dunst and alfred molina make this compelling. the other universal rule is that dvds of superhero films will have making of features only about the effects. this disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film. then there are commentaries, trailers and a blooper reel.sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 john wayne films ranging from the westerns and war movies to the quiet man.now is that a christmas present or what? give this to someone on 24 december and you won't see them again until early in the new year. it's not truly a complete collection and leans more toward wayne's earlier films: there's no true grit, for instance, though there is hellraisers. the films look well transferred to dvd, though none has extras.it was very daft but it knew it was and somehow this famous 1979 series became a cult favourite that's been long awaited on dvd. this set has the first season of buck (gil gerard) and wilma's (erin gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember. but it's also a disappointment. the us dvd has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price. the bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras. that's particularly disappointing because originally there were meant to be commentaries and stars gerard and gray had agreed to do them.\n",

      "dance music not dead says fatboydj norman cook - aka fatboy slim - has said that dance music is not dead, but has admitted it is currently going through a \"fallow patch\".the commercial failure of the latest albums by britain's two biggest dance acts - fatboy slim's palookaville and the prodigy's always outnumbered never outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many \"superclubs,\" and the folding of three dance music magazines. last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize, with the brits committee announcing that \"dance music is no longer where it's happening in music.\" these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, halfway between the gutter and the stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. \"every week when i was making the album, i was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat,\" he told bbc world service's the ticket programme. \"i personally don't believe it's either dead or going to die, but it's going through a bit of a fallow patch. \"so i think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead i would think 'right, scrub that track then'.\"although his album sales in the uk are down - palookaville stayed in the uk top 75 for just three weeks - cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. and event on brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of 360,000. the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year.\"with a crowd that big, if the weather's nice, the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think 'i've got them',\" cook said. \"i'm always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me valium before rio, because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor. \"for some reason, especially now i've got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that's already going on means all i have to do is play 'up' records.\" he promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. one man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party. \"we're having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because there's landlocked countries that want to get involved,\" cook said. \"we're doing rio at the carnival, at the maracana, and sao paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.\"the dj admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life. in particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball, after she was linked with dj dan peppe.\"the tabloid thing has been difficult at times,\" cook said. \"especially the me-and-zoe-gate - it's quite scary.\" he said that he had been \"determined\" that what had happened with ball did not affect the album. \"at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn't think i was depressed,\" he explained. \"then i thought, 'that's not right'.\" and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. \"i said to zoe, 'i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me, do you mind if it's on the album?'\" he recalled. \"she said, 'yeah, it's hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you'.\" cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where paul mccartney is a neighbour. \"it's almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs,\" cook explained. \"if there's a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each other's doors - paul comes round, and we warn him, because we don't know who they're after.\"\n",

some of britain's wealthiest people are musicians who have raked it in from albums, concerts etc. there are far more important demands on government funds.if they can fund football, why not fund music?areas of the arts are funded by government and lottery grants, so why not music? we already have the opera receiving huge grants and it would clearly be beneficial for diversity in music to have the same opportunities in other areas of the music. the only problem would be how to judge what merits state cash.the government has enough problems funding schools and health services. if alex kapranos genuinely thinks a multi-billion pound industry should also have government funding then his own education was seriously lacking and more money should be put into that.as a scot living in england, i appreciate the value of scottish music and culture being a success, so i can see no problem with it! franz ferdinand, travis and snow patrol are just recent examples of the success scottish music can have in the world, so we should do what we scots are good at and support our own goods!i think the issue is more fundamental: should the government be spending money on subsidising a multi-million pound industry when health and education are in such a sorry state? the answer is most definitely no. those people who are lucky enough to pursue their passion to get their pay cheque shouldn't be looking for government subsidies. i know that if i was lucky enough to be able to pursue my dream of show jumping i would want to finance myself until i was in a position to pursue corporate sponsorship.yes the government should fund music - it brings joy to the masses.there are already thousands of state-funded musicians out there sitting around, twiddling their thumbs on the \"new deal\". getting the government even more involved would only waste money that could be put to better use.as long as the government was funding real talent it would be a great move. i would hate to see more pop idol-type funding of music though, as it would only serve to reinforce the stereotypes that alex talked about.only if the proposals make financial sense. franz ferdinand must be paying serious amounts of tax on their record sales - if they'd had a government grant to get started they'd have more than paid it back by now, so the treasury would be making far more than it paid out. however, the government has better things to spend its money on than to give charity to everyone who decides they're a musician. the government shouldn't \"fund\" music - it should \"invest\" in music and those investments should be treated like any other investment.i think the government needs to provide facilities and for young groups and bands to form and practise. the equipment is not cheap and can be well beyond the means of many people. however, i do feel this should be the extent of their role, to provide the conditions for the talent to flourish and let it go from there.i do agree that the government should help to fund music but there is also a responsibility held by record companies! they generally always opt for the tried and tested and tend not to want to break any moulds or risk losing any money which ultimately, the directors are in the business for! if labels were more willing to put money forward towards smaller breakthrough acts then the government wouldn't have to fork out a great deal.yeah, why not? music should be government funded, particularly the work of modern composers and veteran bands/artists and stuff. pop music pretty much rules the earth, so more attention should go to the other fraternitiesi agree with funding the arts to make it more accessible to the public but i am not convinced that pop music requires financial support from the taxpayer. there is a great deal of money generated through pop music - perhaps a tax on pop could be ploughed into the public performance of other forms of music for everyone to enjoy. perhaps we could financially penalise really bad pop idol-style music - that is, the music industry sector without any artistic merit or originality whatsoever and that which is specifically designed to line the pockets of music producers. call it a tax on music \"pollution\", if you like.though i really like franz ferdinand, i have to disagree with mr kapranos. once government gets their hand into the private sector, it will destroy the creative and possibly controversial avenues the artist pursues. many years ago, this was the case with the us nea, when the government started to question what was considered art for the money they were allotting. the solution mr kapranos should pursue would be privately-funded organizations, like save the music in the us.\n",

yeah right.i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out. like every track robbie has released as a single, it's a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before.give us a break...!!!best song in 25 years, you must be joking. its good if you like that sort of thing, but really!listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work. had not heard it for a while. i love robs voice, the lyrics and tune. perfection!as usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for \"the greatest\". there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. it's not exactly groundbreaking. presumably, the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low...i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!what about the specials - ghost town, the buzzcocks - ever fallen in love with someone... happy mondays - kinky afro, mcalmont & butler - yes, joy division - love will tear us apart... angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish.angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. it's musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated, a bit like mr williams himself. this result isn't very surprising though, the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music!best of the last 25 years? maybe. cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. not much competition in the last 25 years after all.it's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.rubbish! who voted it for it to be included in any list? i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years. how depressing and just when we thought manufactured 'pop' was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from?while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. then again, well done robbie, good show.you've got to be kidding.angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years. only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits.i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years! right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good! i'm happy for robbie himself though!best song in the last 25 years? what a joke! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote? angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. soppy rubbish at best. hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today, for me it's proof that music and democracy just don't mix. still, at least it wasn't will young...oh it's all just a bit of fun. people take these awards too seriously! robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels. him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. personally i wanted will young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent!i hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with!i agree about angels. i never get fed up hearing it. whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). the song makes me calm and serene and happy. well done robbie.i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song. it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush.angels is a fantastic song. all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers. it's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. they weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.i've always disliked angels intensely. i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as \"classic\" songwriting. it's 'orrible. it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much. folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer's afternoon picnic. what a dreadful result. if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. booo hisssangels, best song? you are kidding, right? last five years i might be willing to accept, but 25, no way. did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to, say, 1995? really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century.no surprise about robbie williams considering the list. where on earth did the nominations list come from???? compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? i mean, will young? come on.what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so!! what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close.what a joke. that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word 'angels' where i thrash around, and scream \"no no no no no\" until someone tells me \"the radio's off\". why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me. if this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country?? the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! i think not, i didn't realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!!people have such short memories! a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years? not a chance. i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.the great british public at work again. it's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. granted, it's not too bad, either. but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular \"how soon is now?\") or anything from the stone roses' first album? nope.no, because i'm not female and i'm not 10!ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song. but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! the shortlist wasn't great but him winning it is a joke!predictable and laughable.the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years. the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.i am a huge robbie fan and love that song. but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division? a band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will.no doubt about it. there's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song. i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds, the beatles and nick drake have done for music today.yes!! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! robbie was a deserved winner.i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.the best song of the past 25 years? really? come on, this is surely a joke? no? i think i need a long lie down...it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division. i suppose it's confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull :- &lt;(no offence robbie, but pleeease! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music, and a further nail in the coffin!i think robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. anybody who says he doesn't deserve it is jealous of his success. the only real challenger was queen but hey, another one bites the dust!!obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it.if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble. sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.a sad day for musicit's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. it's a good all-rounder. just like robbie.best song in 25 years? since 1980? i'm confused. \"angels\" isn't a bad song. it's a nice, catchy, formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. but this is not great music. if anything it's regressive. bland even. i suppose it's just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become.granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition. the queen's song was lackluster, and apart from kate bush, the other choices were pathetic! also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!best song of the last 25 years? what a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner. sigh. on the upside, at least it wasn't bohemian rhapsody, for which we should all be thankful.angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!! don't get me wrong, i'm not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners.it would have been a travesty had angels not won. without angels, robbie williams may well not be where he is now, and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. it has to be seen performed live, with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. well done rob.i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'. what about britpop? blur, oasis, suede, pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes, doing something different. why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year? the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. the same goes with the scissor sisters, i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near u2's new record, neither are they in the same league. once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit.no surprise really, it's voted for by the general public. since when did they have taste in music?personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard!it absolutely deserved to win. it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.it's an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. all in all a pretty pointless exercise !the song is overplayed and oversentimental. out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either joy division or queen. i suppose we should be thankful that it didn't end up in the hands of will young though.although it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win. everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody, nothing compares 2 u, etc. much better songs and more timeless. give it to someone with real talent.although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that's all it means!\n",
      "jamelia's return to the topr&b star jamelia had three brit nominations to go with her triple triumph at last year's mobo awards.the birmingham-born singer, full name jamelia davis, was signed to a record label at the age of 15 and released her first single so high at 18. she released four number ones from her 2000 album drama, including the top five hit money featuring the vocals of reggae artist beenie man. she racked up five mobo nominations in 2000, winning one for best video. but in the same year she also fell pregnant and decided to take a break from music to bring up her daughter teja, who was born in march 2001. while she originally planned to get back to work pretty swiftly after giving birth it was actually two years before she released another single. during her absence r&b music exploded and a whole host of female artists were on the scene, meaning jamelia had to once again prove herself. her comeback song bout featuring rah digga only just scrapped into the top 40.it was her next single, superstar, that really put her back on the map as one of britain's most popular female r&b singers, holding her own in a music scene dominated by us artists such as beyonce and ashanti.superstar was followed by thank you, winner of best single at the 2004 mobos, which reached number two in the uk charts. the autobiographical song, which deals with domestic abuse, hit number one in new zealand and australia. next came the song see it in a boy's eyes, which was especially written for her by coldplay's chris martin. his involvement with the song meant not only was it given massive publicity but it was also greeted favourably by a new audience who would not usually listen to r&b. she now combines singing with modelling and supporting charities including the nspcc and make trade fair. despite her huge success in recent years, jamelia remains down-to-earth about her fame and her chances of lasting in the fickle music business, partly due to motherhood. \"when i first got into the industry, i'd be away from home for months at a time. but now i have other things in my life. i still want to make it, but it's not the end of the world if i don't,\" commented jamelia.\n",
      "cult band kasabian surge forwardindie dance band kasabian built up a cult following throughout 2004 to secure three brit award nominations.the four-piece leicester band blends dark electronics with rock, earning kasabian places on the best british group, rock act and live act shortlists. they have also earned a reputation as outspoken and charismatic, in contrast to fellow brit nominees such as keane and snow patrol. \"british music needs a kick up the arse and britain needs a new band to breathe life into the british people again,\" declared kasabian's singer tom meighan.\"no-one's doing it at the minute. music feels like it's in the afterlife right now. we don't want people to give up on it. \"the serpent's going to rise from the sea and scare all the pirates away!\" meighan grew up in leicester with kasabian songwriter/guitarist sergio pizzorno and bassist chris edwards, a trio which began making music from the age of 17.they enlisted guitarist and keyboard player christopher karloff after spotting him in a pub. \"we saw his long sideburns and thought 'hey, he looks the part, we'll ask him,'\" said meighan. inspired by britpop and a mutual love of hardcore, an early 1990s genre that fused house music with hip hop beats and a dark sensibility, they added an electronic element to the traditional guitar sound. \"we got a computer and we cut rock'n'roll up, because there's no point in going back to how it was,\" said meighan. \"it's all about new ideas and creativity.\"the band's original approach is reflected in its name, inspired by linda kasabian - the getaway driver of us serial killer charles manson. coincidentally it is also the armenian term for \"butcher\". kasabian moved into a remote farmhouse in rutland to record their debut album, benefiting from its isolation but also managing to sneak in a few parties while they were there. signed to the rca record label, kasabian tested the water with two singles, club foot and lsf, which reached numbers 19 and 10 in the uk singles chart respectively.they built up their following on the summer festival circuit, opening both glastonbury and t in the park, and at a series of \"guerilla gigs\" at unusual venues including half time orange, a pub next to leicester city football club's headquarters. kasabian's self-titled album was released last september to widespread critical acclaim, its indie dance stance drawing comparisons to the stone roses, primal scream and the happy mondays.regarding it as \"both a fiery assertion of rock 'n' roll ethics and proof that a siege mentality is alive and well in the badlands of rutland water\", the nme's praise was typical of the album's reception. as 2004 progressed kasabian would score a further two hits - processed beats and cutt off - and embark upon a well-received uk tour. \"we take our music seriously, definitely, but we want to have fun with it,\" said pizzorno. \"this is not a job to us,\" added meighan. \"this is the best life we could ever have. this is what it's all about and without it we'd be lost souls. but music needs us as well.\"\n",
      "brits debate over 'urban' musicjoss stone, a 17-year-old soul singer from devon, beat dizzee rascal, jamelia, lemar and the streets to win best british urban act at the brit awards. her victory has reignited the debate about what urban music is.i'm not really comfortable with the word urban. it's a word that's been manufactured in this country and america to describe black music. the word urban seems to cover such a broad range of black music that it's wrong. how far are the brits removed from inner-city music and what people are doing? it's so far removed that i don't expect them to get it bang on. the music industry isn't championing music from our particular genre very well anyway. people don't feel like that's anything to do with us. i don't feel like urban music's just been celebrated by [joss stone] winning or her being nominated, or by the brits acknowledging that there's an urban music scene because it's all a kick in the teeth at the end of the day. it's not really relevant. if joss stone is the closest thing that they feel comfortable championing because of what she looks like and how she sounds and who she's signed to, then so be it. it's got nothing to do with what's really going on.urban as a genre is very broad. if you look underneath urban, there are a number of core elements that include hip-hop, r&b, garage and into that obviously comes soul. joss stone is a soul artist. her first album was called the soul sessions. so urban is a very broad brushstroke that is the umbrella over the top of sub-genres, and there are offshoots of all of those. joss stone has had amazing success [in the us] given that she's a uk artist. what has really captured everybody's imagination is that here you have a 17-year-old from devon with a voice to die for and a bunch of really, really good tunes and she looks good - i think that's what's done it.the award for best british urban act was voted for by viewers of mtv base.i don't think joss was not a worthy winner. she makes soul music and that definitely comes under the category of what we describe as urban. the fact that she's from devon is the interesting thing because most of the music we cover is made in large cities and she's literally rural. the great thing about urban music is that there's a big range. if there is some sort of root with black music or dance music in britain, i think that's where you can call it urban - that's where this new sub-category, or uber-category, has come from. joss stone is certainly not old enough to have had some of the experiences of an older soul singer, but you couldn't argue that she was being inauthentic with her emotions - it is coming from somewhere genuine. it has to come across as real. that's the only cut-off point we have here and that's the only way by which we judge people.what urban means to us as an organisation is the politically correct term to describe music which originated from a black background. music should become inclusive and if we are fighting for a multi-cultural britain, then we should be fighting for inclusion rather than exclusion. if joss stone can be accepted within the urban music community, i think acts from other ethnicities doing classical music and rock should be accepted too. race doesn't make a difference if everyone is included. out of all the awards dished out yesterday, i'm still trying to find out what people of other races received any sort of recognition or award.a type of music (especially street music) that originates from a city, and typically reflects or is characteristic of urban life.she might not be urban, but when did r&b become the hip hop tainted thing it is now? r&b stands for rhythm and blues, remember!that joss stone is rubbish is certain. if anyone deserves to win an award for urban music (i think probably should include hip-hop, soul & funk at least but not rock or pop) this year its the streets, although dizzee rascal stakes a good claimshe definitely deserved to win a prize, joss stone's albums are quite simply amazing, easily better than anything else that was released last year. this whole debate about what is urban, what isnt urban is completely pointless and probably fueled by urban artists who weren't nominated or didn't win. i cant see why people can't just congratulate her for the talent that she is.she did deserve it, but i agree with the comments about urban music. its a stupid phrase, and particularly british. in the states they tend to use hip hop and r&b, if i say hip hop here a lot of people have no idea what i'm talking about. very strange.what's in a name? a rose by any other name etc... if people want to call it urban, why not? if we really analysed it, the term 'dance music' is misleading because it doesn't describe everything you can dance to.whilst i agree that the term 'urban' is open to interpretation, it strikes me as simply weird that joss stone has won. 'urban' to me is what i hear being played in parties in the inner cities - i live in brixton and have never heard the soul sessions pumping out of of a bass heavy sound system in any parties i've been to. good luck to joss stone, let's celebrate her victory - let's also question why, with artists so successful and talented as jamelia, lemar, kanye west, dizzee rascal, alicia keys and outkast - we didn't see a single black artist on stage collecting an award.so, what you're saying is that any music that has black heritage is not allowed to be sung by anyone who isn't black. and, if it is, then they shouldn't be acknowledged for it even if they're pretty dam good at it? she's 17, has an amazing voice, and won. good on her. oh, but she's not \"black\" well, let's make her feel real bad about it then. how dare she! though hang on, didn't the so-called 'public' vote on this one?this idea of pigeonholing whatever is popular at the time is no different than what was happening in the 1940s and 50s in relation to what \"jazz\" was. the media then called anything that had a swinging beat, syncopated melody or soulful feeling \"jazz\", much to the chagrin of the artists. it would mean that \"blues\" would be put in the same mould as \"bebop\", \"cool\" and \"ragtime\", all very different styles at that time. jazz was and remains such a massively misunderstood term. and so what of \"urban\" music? in truth it's a lazy term to categorise music that you don't really understand. soul and garage are worlds apart musically (marvin gaye v tuff jam?), but no doubt have their connections. if we just let the music speak for itself and not judge the success of an artist by the number of awards won, then maybe we can enjoy the music for what it is, rather than what it represents.i demand a prize for rural music! sucks to the cities- it's way better out here. we have hay, for one thing.excluding her from what has become known as urban music would be as bad as excluding lenny kravitz or hendrix from rock music for being black surely? i dont understand the point that ty is making. if lemar, who makes music which is less soulful than joss' work won, he might have said nothing. (btw i'm black too)how can she be \"urban\" if she spent most of her life in the devon countryside? nonsense.i love joss to bits and don't care what her branding is - it's amazing music, full stop. stop puting it all in brackets and let's just call it music, and let's especially drop the black / urban tag - nearly all music came from black origin, this just sets an example that it is ok to pigeonhole people and their music by their colour.surely the point of having an urban music category is simply to acknowledge artists that are making what is (historically) considered urban music, irrelevent of the colour of their skin, or where they originate from. joss stone is simply singing a certain type of music that can be considered urban in style, just as someone from an inner city, and indeed not from the usa could sing country music. if that person was good at it and authentic in sound, would we criticise it being referred to as country music or the artist for representing that style?the term urban in reference to a music genre in uk has developed, in part, from the controversy surrounding the branding of the mobo awards. the very term 'music of black origin' has confused and offended many people. this is particularly strange given the existence of the asian music awards. it appears that the use of 'black' or 'white' in relation to music makes people feel uncomfortable. the term 'urban' therefore, has been invoked to sidestep the debate of which type of music came first 'black' or 'white' thereby rendering the issue colourblind. the result is now a redundant new debate as to what 'urban' also means. perhaps we should have created a new term altogether to describe the various strains of soul/rnb and hip-hop, one which does not also mean something else - as we have done with 'crunk'.urban is just a word that's come about recently to describe \"black\" music that's become popular now. the word wasn't even in use, or common use five of six years ago. it's just a way of the industry clumping it all together without having to call it black music, because some people are oversensitive and might call them racist for it.i'm in a band that has been called \"urban\", and i despise the label. i'd hate to think i belonged to any neat marketing niche, because that's all it is. ever since the music channels and record comapnies tried to fracture what they consider 'music of black origin', these labels have been used to undermine the status of good music into a commodity. look at all the tv broadcasters, unable to reach young people without condesending, they simply play some 'urban' music on the soundtrack as if its some dreadful cheap lift music. ignore the labels, it is what it is, just music.as a black man, i think i agree with some of the statements at least the statements made by the key executives. black people should lead the music they invented . we should stop calling a genre meaningless, northing is meaningless. the real question is would joss stone would have been that successful doing the music she was doing if she were black? same thing, with streets, amy winehouse, etc. who's ever heard of terri walker or rhian benson.. they are both 10 times better than joss stone and both of them have won urban music awards and i think mobos , but why not brits????so what if joss stone won the urban awards. her music is great soul and surely that is under the 'urban' banner? what if the streets had won? would people be whining because mike skinner is white... it seems that a lot of the fuss is about race where the real issue should be music and nothing else.urban is pc version for saying black music. i'm not doubting ms stone's talent, but why didn't jamelia or lemar get a brit? this reminds me of what happened to craig david and soul ii soul in the past, getting nominations are easy to get, but picking up a brit seems to be the hardest thing.refreshing to see people making reasonable, intelligent comments on any topic these days. more power to you, people! you have said it: there is music you like and music you don't like - who cares what label you put on it?that entire category was a mess. how can you have people like dizzee rascal up against joss stone? its like putting eminem against bob geldof. she should have been nominated for best british r & b act. joss stone deserved to win an award for her talents, but i don't think it was very 'urban' of her to sing angels with robbie williams.urban is a nonsense term - music of black origin? well doesn't that include rock? music made in the inner cities? well almost all bands end up making music in london/manchester etc. and doesn't that make some weird implication that all black people live in cities? it doesn't make any sense.why does music have to be put into a genre? it's music, you like it or you don't. simple as that.i play in a heavy metal band. we are urban music as far as i'm concerned. we live in cities and spend our working life in an urban environment; it therefore directly shapes what we write musically.\"urban\" seems to be the new name for all styles of black music. why it needed a rebrand i don't know as the name is misleading. oasis originate from a city and characterise the urban life they know, therefore more than fit the term \"urban\" yet as they're a white rock band they won't be described as such.joss stone has a fantastic voice and great timing and delivery - what other reason do they need to award her the brit? all this \"urban\" and other such categorisation is just the red-tape of the music business and is best ignored.yeah, she deserved it. she is talented. urban is a crap, meaningless, politically correct and probably actually racist marketing term though. there's only two kinds of music: good and bad.\n",
      "row threatens hendrix museum planproposals to open a museum dedicated to jimi hendrix are flailing because of a row over the home of his late father.the run-down house in seattle has already been moved wholesale once and local authorities are now demanding it be moved to another site. hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist. \"the mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed jimi hendrix's house,\" said ray rae marshall of the james marshall hendrix foundation. the foundation moved the building, in which al hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002. now the city of seattle wants its new plot to be used for development, giving a deadline of 22 february for the home to be moved. mr goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre. seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.\"we never said, 'you can own this property,'\" said john franklin, chief of its operations department. \"from our perspective, it was a temporary situation. we have not threatened to demolish the house. we've simply asked that they have to move it.\" now mr goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to seattle's central district, where hendrix grew up. janie hendrix, the guitarist's stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him. \"that's something my father really wanted to see,\" she said. \"it would be nice if we didn't have to fight for everything to get it.\" hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time. he died of drug overdose in 1970 at the age of 27.\n",
      "no jail for singer courtney lovesinger courtney love has been spared jail for assault and drug offences, but must serve three years probation.she had back-to-back court appearances in two separate cases in los angeles, first pleading no contest to attacking a woman with a whisky bottle. in the second, ms love, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing a forged prescription and painkiller oxycodone. she must also do 100 hours community service, have drug treatment, attend narcotics anonymous and pay a fine. the ex-hole singer's lawyer howard weitzman said ms love had \"turned her life around\" and she was \"clean and sober\".the assault charge stemmed from april 2004, when ms love found musician kristin king in her boyfriend's home. ms king said the singer \"threw the bottle at the left side of my face\" in an \"angry, vicious and erratic\" attack. ms love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault. judge rand rubin said she must:- spend three years on probation - have one year's anger management counselling - have one year's drug rehabilitation - do 100 hours community service - pay $1,000 (â£535) fine - have random drug tests - go to three narcotics anonymous meetings per weekin the drugs case, she was sentenced to 18 months probation, to run concurrently with the probation for the assault. that offence stemmed from october 2003, when she suffered an overdose after breaking a window at her boyfriend's home. in a separate case relating to the same incident, ms love was sentenced to 18 months in drug rehabilitation for being under the influence of cocaine and opiates. in another case last october, she pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for hitting a man on the head with a microphone stand at a new york city nightclub. last month her lawyers said she had won back custody of frances bean, her 12-year-old daughter with former nirvana frontman kurt cobain. the girl was removed from her care following her double arrest in october 2003. cobain committed suicide in 1994.\n",
      "rapper kanye west's shrewd soulus hip-hop star kanye west - who leads the race for this year's grammys with 10 nominations - rose to prominence by producing songs for artists such as jay-z and alicia keys.he then emerged from his behind-the-scenes role to become an artist as well as a producer. but his solo career almost ended before it began after a near-fatal car crash left west with his jaw wired shut in 2002. the resulting song, through the wire, became west's first uk hit in april 2004 and subsequent album the college dropout became a transatlantic success, both critically and commercially. west, 26, began rapping as a teenager at his chicago school, inspired by the beats and rhymes of 1980s pioneers run dmc.hip-hop producer no id encouraged west to sample old soul and r&b hits then revive them with an updated sound, an approach that would become his trademark. \"i feel like a lot of the soul that's in those old records that i sample is in me,\" he said. \"so when i hear them and i put them with the drums and i bring them to the new millennium, it's just like god's doing that. i'm one with them records right there. it's a blessing.\"leaving his chicago art school after only one year - a move which would later inspire the title of his album - west began his music career co-producing songs for artists mase and the madd rapper. this drew the attention of superstar rapper jay-z, who signed west up to his roc-a-fella record label to produce numerous artists on his roster. west's work gained mainstream recognition when he produced the singles takeover and izzo (hova) on jay-z's own 2001 album blueprint. incorporating samples of five to one by the doors and the jackson five's i want you back respectively, the hits were credited with injecting soul back into hip-hop.as their success attracted further production work for jay-z ('03 bonnie & clyde) and artists such as ludacris (stand up) and alicia keys (you don't know my name), west announced plans for a solo album. driving home from a late-night los angeles recording session in october 2002, he was involved in the car crash that left his jaw fractured in three places. \"anytime i hear about any accident my heart sinks in and i just thank god that i'm still here,\" he later said. \"that steering wheel could have been two inches further out, and that would have been it.\"west's account of the accident sampled chaka khan's hit through the fire to become the heart of his completed solo album the college dropout. released last year, it was by turns smooth, humorous and sharp and largely avoided the clich&#233;d hip-hop preoccupation with guns, girls and jewellery.through the wire was quickly joined in the uk and us charts by slow jamz, on which west collaborated with rapper twista and ray actor jamie foxx. the college dropout spawned two further uk hits and a string of award nominations. west was shortlisted for 10 grammys - including nominations for artist and album of the year - and took the best hip-hop artist, producer and album titles at last year's music of black origin (mobo) awards. now a respected rapper and producer in the influential field of hip-hop, kanye west is unlikely to regret his decision to leave college early.\n",

      "u2's desire to be number oneu2, who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive, if not always groundbreaking. but such success is down to more than music. they have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. they also have to want it. they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. the beatles had it, the rolling stones still have it, rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit. and u2 have it in spades, and keep churning it out. their new album, how to dismantle an atomic bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and 17 years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all-time rock a-list.they may have lost some of the edginess and raw, youthful force that propelled them to the top, but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the uk singles chart at number one, knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit. \"the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,\" bono recently said. drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments: \"we're very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles. we don't want to be thought of as a veteran band.\" the band have done \"everything in their considerable powers\" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to q magazine editor paul rees.\"this makes them hugely determined and formidable.\" he added: \"they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. \"as such, they've constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. they are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age.\" the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised, mr rees said. \"they do everything in the right way.\" the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board, attracting fellow pupils paul hewson (bono, vocals), adam clayton (bass), david evans (the edge, guitar) and his brother dick.dick evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2.by 1978, they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager, paul mcguinness. \"they were brilliant, but very coarse,\" mcguinness recently said. \"in a way, they were doing exactly what they do now. only badly.\" they struggled to attract record company attention, later being described as \"pretty damn average\" and \"strange and eerie\" by scouts who saw them live. they released two ireland-only singles, which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980, leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy. the stadium-filling, anthemic sound was u2's aim from the start, and their third album, war, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic, going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us. songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year's day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which bono rejected as a cliche.his stage performances - which included flag-waving, speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer, and their appearance at 1985's live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.in 1987, the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name, i still haven't found what i'm looking for and with or without you. those songs took the band's epic, atmospheric sound to a simple, powerful and popular pinnacle. the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal. the achtung baby album in 1991 was followed by zooropa, pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone calls to the white house and bono's transformation into alter-egos the fly and macphisto. he was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids. before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world. but they still want more.\n",
      "lasting influence of legend charlesray charles, who has won a string of posthumous grammy awards, belonged to a pioneering generation of artists that had a huge influence on the course of rock and pop music.his sound encompassed so many styles - blues, gospel, jazz, rock 'n' roll, even country - and had a real impact on the nascent uk beat and r&b scenes.compared in stature to elvis presley by some commentators, charles' songs cast their spell on such 1960s stalwarts as joe cocker, steve winwood, eric burdon and van morrison. his influence has extended to contemporary artists such as norah jones, with whom he recently recorded a duet. if james brown was the godfather of soul, then ray charles was indisputably one of its founding fathers. along with sam cooke, he was instrumental in bringing together the gospel fervour of the deep south baptist church with the \"devil's\" music of r&b to pave the way for a new generation of soul artists.without charles, it is hard to imagine the tear-stained atlantic r&b sound of aretha franklin, otis redding or wilson pickett. he was also a talented jazz composer, arranger and band leader, playing at the newport jazz festival and carnegie hall and recording with noted jazz musicians such as milt jackson and david \"fathead\" newman. unfortunately, he also shared another trait common among many jazz artists of the era - that of heroin addiction, which led to him being arrested in 1965. his string of 1950s atlantic r&b successes included songs that would be covered by the first-generation rock 'n' roll greats, including i've got a woman (roy orbison, elvis presley) and hallelujah, i love her so (eddie cochran). after the exuberance of his 1959 signature song what'd i say, charles turned towards a more pop-oriented style, recording hoagy carmichael's sentimental string ballad georgia on my mind, and the upbeat hit the road jack.he also won acclaim in the country arena with his interpretations of hank williams standards such as your cheating heart and you win again. more than 40 years after its release, his 1962 abc album modern sounds in country and western music is still regarded as a classic. his version of don gibson's i can't stop loving you topped the pop and r&b charts in the us. in 1972, he made a rare foray into protest songs with his album a message from the people.on it, he took a stand on poverty and civil rights - echoing similar recordings of the era from progeny such as stevie wonder, james brown, curtis mayfield and marvin gaye. more than 20 years later, he would embrace contemporary production with his 1993 album my world, which featured hip-hop beats - although charles claimed at the time not to know what hip-hop was. among the tributes that poured in from all sections of the music world when charles died aged 73 in june 2004 was one from his friend, the producer quincy jones, who described him as a \"brother in every sense of the word\". \"there will never be another musician who did as much to break down the perceived walls of musical genres as much as ray charles did,\" he said. former manfred mann singer paul jones, who sang on 1960s hits such as come tomorrow and sha la la, said charles was one of his heroes. \"i'm quite sure my own writing was influenced by him,\" he told bbc news online. \"i would put money on the proposition that ray charles will have an influence on music forever.\"\n",

      "the comic book genius of stan leestan lee, the man responsible for a string of comic superheroes that have become household names, has won a court battle for a slice of the profits from the hit spider-man movies.many marvel at the man who gave his characters extraordinary powers and everyday headaches - a formula which revolutionised comics. born in 1922 to poor working-class jewish immigrants from romania, stan lieberman, got a job in timely publications, a company owned by a relative. he was assigned to the comics division and - thanks to a fertile imagination - rose to editor by the age of 18. for more than 20 years, he was \"the ultimate hack\" - knocking out crime stories, horrors, westerns, anything to sate the appetite of his juvenile readership. words of more than two syllables were discouraged. characters were either all good or bad, with no shades of grey. so embarrassed was lieberman by much of what he was writing that he refused to put his real name on the byline. he assumed the \"dumb name\", stan lee, now legally adopted.by the time he was 40, lee had decided he was too old for the comic game. his british-born wife, joan, suggested he had nothing to lose and, for his swansong, should write the kind of characters he really wanted to create. after a rival comic had come up with a superteam consisting of batman, superman and wonder woman, timely needed to respond.lee's answer, in 1961, was the fantastic four - a team of astronauts who gained super powers after being bombarded with cosmic rays. they were to change lee's life, and the comics industry, forever. lee gave each character individual, everyday teenage problems such as dandruff, ingrown toenails and acne. they would frequently fall out with their parents and each other. the fan letters poured in. without immediately knowing it, stan lee had ushered in the golden age of comics, and his imagination was rekindled. his marvel universe spawned the new title of marvel comics. soon after, nerdy peter parker was transformed - after a bite from an irradiated spider - into someone who could crawl up the sides of new york's skyscrapers. spider-man was born. he was to become an icon of modern popular culture. spidey, as he is affectionately known, had quite extraordinary powers - yet he had problems at work, at home and with his girlfriends. at last, the teenager was no longer just the sidekick, but the main hero. and the hero was no longer just brawn, he had brains too.\"just because he's a hero and has super powers doesn't mean he doesn't have problems,\" stan lee told the bbc. the incredible hulk, the mighty thor, iron man and the rest all grappled with problems like drug abuse, bigotry and social inequality. radically, lee gave the artists responsible for the comic designs credits for their work. jack kirby, frank miller, john romitaand and others achieved cult status in their own right. other superheroes broke new ground in other ways. daredevil was blind, black panther was black and silver surfer pondered the state of humanity. lee's influence remains. some years ago the marvel hero, northstar, came out of the closet. in its heyday, marvel was selling 50 million copies a year. until he retired from editing in 1971, stan lee wrote all the copy for marvel's covers.in 1999, his stan lee media venture, aimed at marrying comic-strips with the internet, went spectacularly wrong. lee went bankrupt and his business partner landed in prison for fraud. in 2001 though, he started a new company entitled pow! (purveyors of wonder) entertainment, which is currently developing films and television programmes. his latest project is a superhero based on a real person - jay j armes, who has metal claws after losing both hands aged 12 and fights crime with a tiger. but his 40-year-old creations are still as enduring as ever - with x-men, the hulk and daredevil have all been turned into hollywood action movies in the last five years. but spider-man has been the biggest box office hit, with the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel taking almost $1.6bn (â£857m) in ticket sales around the world - before dvd and merchandise sales are counted. it seems stan lee is as indestructible as his heroes.\n",
      "bangkok film festival battles onorganisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this year's event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster.the festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. \"when the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,\" said the festival's executive director, craig prater. \"the decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.\"our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,\" he continued. \"but we feel like we've turned a page. we've acknowledged our position, and now it's business as usual.\"mr prater's sentiments were echoed by christine rush, director of the festival's sister event, the bangkok film market. \"we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nation's recovery from this terrible disaster,\" she said.\"however, the nation's recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. \"we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,\" she added. given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. however, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leigh's abortion drama vera drake. that said, the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.on a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. problems securing air transport, the clash with last sunday's golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher, alongside such screen stars as michael douglas, jeremy irons and jean-claude van damme. irons, whose film being julia is in competition for the festival's golden kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after december's catastrophe. \"i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened,\" the british actor said. \"i thought it might be in rather bad taste. but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on. \"now i've come here i'm very glad. what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west,\" he continued. \"basically i was invited here by thailand. if they still want you to come, you should.\"now in its third year, bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong, tokyo and pusan in south korea, mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal. \"it's grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,\" he concedes. \"we've had some bumps in the road, but that's only because the festival is still a baby. \"i have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top asian film festival in the world.\" the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday. the festival itself runs until 24 january.\n",

      "how the academy awards flourishedthe 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. but from humble beginnings, how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today?how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.the first film to win was wings, which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman's chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday, then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953, with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar? there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar.one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn's first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2,530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort, the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement? the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5,700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy, receipt of an academy award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.among the overlooked films were hobson's choice, dirty harry, the 39 steps, the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927), humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944), gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq, but as it didn't stop during world war ii or the vietnam war.documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars, including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was \"demeaning\". writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers' guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood's apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz.the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared \"come on up and get it, frank\" to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade.capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.\n",

      "bening makes awards breakthroughfilm actress annette bening is up for an oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film being julia.bening, who was born in texas in 1958, has gained prominence for a string of key roles. although an oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of hollywood's favourite actresses remains solid. one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for bening's role as troubled carolyn burnham in 1999's american beauty. but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swank's leading role in boys don't cry. after opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a tony award nomination in 1986 - bening had a low-key spell in television. she then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988's the great outdoors, opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy.following a cameo in postcards from the edge, bening's breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters - a role that won her an oscar nomination. despite some rave reviews, bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award.however the high-profile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions, co-starring with some of hollywood's greatest players, including robert de niro and harrison ford. but it was her role opposite warren beatty in 1991 gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact. bening played virginia hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 oscar nominations.bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening - she married beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe. the couple now have four children together. a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered bening's career in the mid-1990s. she played michael douglas' opposite number in romantic comedy the american president, and as a \"fiery\" queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeare's richard iii.bening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty, director sam mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance. but current film being julia has made bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the golden globes. the witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young american - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award.\n",
      "oscars steer clear of controversythe oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore's bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit 9/11 and mel gibson's the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit 9/11 breaking us box office records for a documentary, and the passion of the christ making more than us$370m (â£196m) in the us alone. but this year's academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the palme d'or at the cannes international film festival in 2004.moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says tim dams, the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore's film does not sit well with the academy. \"if you look at past oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. fahrenheit 9/11 didn't really fit in to that category. \"they tend to go for films like titanic, gladiator, and the lord of the rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,\" he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not \"snubbing\" moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. \"i think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,\" he said.the problem with mel gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic, an ancient middle eastern language.\"hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,\" he said. but aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. but mr dams said: \"it's not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany, and it's a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster.\" another 'contentious' film, mr dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its 'super size' portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress.the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said: \"it's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced. \"morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy. it's a very accessible film, and it doesn't beat you over the head with its views. \"while in fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, i think the way that super size me is put together - the fact it's a very likeable film - means it's won through on charm.\" dam's pick at this year's oscars? the aviator, martin scorsese's biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes. tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.\n",

      "roundabout continues nostalgia tripthe new big-screen version of the magic roundabout, released in the uk on friday, is the latest attempt to turn children's television into box-office gold.recent years have seen a less-than-successful adaptation of the 1960s puppet show thunderbirds and a moderately successful version of e nesbit's five children and it, previously filmed by the bbc in 1991. he-man and transformers, which were cartoon favourites in the 1980s, will soon receive their own costly makeovers. with screen versions of the a-team, the dukes of hazzard and even blake's seven on the cards, nostalgia is clearly big business. but some critics complain that these expensive takes on iconic series of yesteryear do not match up to our fond memories of the originals. the new version of the magic roundabout, which will be released as sprung! in the us, replaces the stop-motion models of the 1960s tv show with polished, computer-generated animation.in a similar fashion, the 2004 thunderbirds used human actors and special effects in place of the original's puppets and models. the films are squarely pitched at younger audiences. pop stars robbie williams and kylie minogue provide voices in the magic roundabout, while the now-defunct boy band busted performed the thunderbirds theme song. but while some reviewers have been won over, there has nonetheless been a significant backlash. \"this cg-animated adventure airbrushes the sly charm and trippy otherworldliness which made the 60s stop-motion roundabout a cult hit,\" writes stella papamichael on the bbc movies site.and the recent puppet comedy team america: world police was in part provoked by its directors' outrage that gerry anderson's thunderbirds was remade without its signature mannequins. dan jolin, reviews editor of empire magazine, says classic children's tv shows have a built-in audience that make them ideal for reinvention.\"i can understand why people are taking these intellectual properties and repackaging them for the kids of today. \"but i think it's backfiring. what's next - the clangers on some distant planet, with some giant cgi soup dragons chasing after them?\" despite thunderbirds' disappointing global box-office performance - the film cost $42m (â£22m) but only recouped $21m (â£11m) - the nostalgia craze shows no signs of abating. it can therefore be only a matter of time before some other tv favourites receive the hollywood treatment.after the success of garfield: the movie, britain's shabby tabbysurely deserves his own film vehicle. with only 13 episodes made of the 1974 series, there is plenty of room to explore the lives of the pink cat, professor yaffle and the mice of the marvellous mechanical mouse organ.furry recyclershave already had one big-screen outing - 1977's wombling free. but with environmental issues still occupying our thoughts it is high time they made a comeback. advances in special effects technology could do wonders for the bbc's supernatural comedy. and the success of pirates of the caribbean must surely herald a comeback for tv's most popular cartoon buccaneer,. it might also remind viewers the lewd character names often associated with the show never actually existed.the magic roundabout is out in the uk on 11 february.how about bringing catweazle to the big screen? he could give gandalf a run for his money!thundercats!! i loved it. should be fun to see on the big screen, if some effort is put in! it will bring my youth back!get your hands off the clangers! is nothing sacred?make a movie version of the banana splits!what about keanu reeves and richard gere in a remake of the wooden tops? or perhaps robbie williams could get his much mooted acting career off the ground by taking on the role of andy pandy.you forgot to mention the grearest of them all, danger mouse! but then again, it couldn't be better than the original series, could it?it's always nice to see these old toons re-released, but after the abysmal thunderbirds movie (and the song!) i think i've been completely put off. just leave these classics alone as good memories.i think remakes are a good idea. as the world moves on people tend to look more and more into the past to things that make them feel safe. i believe this is the whole reason \"retro\" has become so popular. as long as a remake does justice to the original then all it can do is create a wider audience and possibly entice a new generation of persons to enjoy and revive and old series. personally i'd like to see cartoons such as transformers, thundercats and m.a.s.k. get full hollywood remakes.leave them alone, why ruin something that we all have very fond memories of in the first place? the thunderbirds film was apalling, not a patch on the puppet series i grew up with and the magic roundabout will never be the same without the voice of eric thompson.love to see transformers with real actors and cgi. and make it at least a 15 rating.part of the reason for the success of such classics as the magic roundabout was that the characters were not the sweet and cuddly creatures that you would expect. they were moody, sarcastic, and rather human. just looking at the pictures of the animations for the new film show that these characteristics have not been preserved. dougal never smiled like that! films of this sort have an unfortunate habit of disneyfying everthing, and they just lose the real magic that made the show special in the first place.i have fond memories of bod (not least of which because i look like him) and would like to see someone attempt to make it into a film. it's got all the right material for an american blockbuster - no plot and no story. bod would likely be played by tom cruise and would undoubtedly have a girlfriend or two.it's all very well and good remaking these classic tv shows and films with all the latest technology for a 'new' audience, but for me a lot of the original charm is lost when they do this, and seems more like a money making exercise to cash in on the original success of the programme than reinventing or improving it. it maybe that to an audience who have never seen the originals they can watch them without prejudice, but to people who have grown up with all these shows such as thunderbirds and magic roundabout which are part of our childhood, they are never going to live up to expectation. it does pose the question though that with all the long line of remakes being made, are film-makers running out of original ideas?all i can say is bring back danger mouse, probably the greatest kids' show ever. i recently re-watched some episodes and realised that there was a level of humour shown in danger mouse that was completely lost on me when i was a child.there was a new captain pugwash cartoon made a couple of years back. again, like so many of these nostalgia programmes, the animation - this time computer created flat-cell like animation - failed to match the original's cut out paper technique for inventiveness, and was woefully inadequate. we live in a sampling world - the music industry has been pludering past decades for inspiration, clipping sounds from 20 years ago is much cheaper and easier that doing something new. seems that the film and tv is doing the same now - it's just cheaper to take ideas from the past and rework them, rather than being daring and trying something new.it got to be mr.benn. the story line about a man who changes in a fancy dress shop, steps into a door way and appears in another time and place would be amazing! if they got a decent producer and writer the story line could be great. and who to play the lead role? well if it was a comedy then it would have to be someone like steve martin. if its going to be an adventure then johnny depp playing a role similar to the pirates of the caribbean character.muffin the mule perhaps ? after all, grannies and grandpas go to the cinema as well you know!why can't the british film industry try making gerry anderson's ufo or captain scarlet, or saphire and steel, or the tomorrow people.in today's media, it seems the past is the future. tv shows such as battlestar galactica have new remakes, dj's are sampling or re-working 70's and 80's music. even computer games from 10-15 years ago are getting modern re-workings. personally, i think it shows that no one has any originality any more! why not just leave our misty-eyed nostalgia alone.mary, mungo and midge. but of course for most of the episodes the lift would be out of order and they would have to use the stairs. plus would mary be more of a vicky pollard character as she lives in a high rise council block? yeah but no but i wasn't even there!i'd like to see mr. benn, with brad pitt in the title role. sean connery could play the mysterious costume shop owner.it demonstrates a profound lack of imagination in today's film-makers that they continually try to remake and remodel the past in an effort to cash in on nostalgia. there are plany of modern children's book that would make excellent films or tv programmes, why not use them instead of rehashing the past?mr. benn with rowan atkinson as the lead.would have loved to see dungeons & dragons made, but unfortunately the film that it was made into didn't come up to scratch. the only one that isn't to be remade as yet is thundercats, which i'd like to see.i'm an expat living in norway, and i recently went through a period of buying the dvds of many of my favourite children's programs for my 2 daughters. my dearest wish, however, is to see a feature length version of noggin the nog appear on the big screen!! very scandinavian...rainbow!i believe that childrens classics should be left well alone, and i will not be surprised if the magic roundabout does not do well at the box office, especially since it will be going up against the spongebob squarepants movie, popular among children because it's original, witty, and modern. the magic roundabout will never appeal to the children of today as it did all those many years ago.how about classics like chorlton and the wheelies, rentaghost, terrahawks, bod.....oh the list could go on and on!!!if a transformers movie is indeed on the cards then i'll be the first one on amazon buying a copy, eagerly waiting at the front door with a frothy mouth and a nervous twitch. repackage my childhood and sell it to me at an extortionate price! i don't care! till then i'll have to make do with the citreon c4 advert.i'd luv to see willow the wisp on the big screen but sadly without the late kenneth williams doing the voices it wouldnt be the same. and who remembers trap door voiced by the late willie rushden, superb children's programme. could morph hold his own in a big screen movie??? or even jamie and the magic torch....hmmmmm, i could go on and on. danger mouse? at 34 i'm showing my age. :-)noggin the nog was one of the best children's programs. the problem with bringing it to the big screen is that no-one could approach oliver postgate's wonderful voices. so in general leave well alone. the originals are good because they are of their time and the methods used are an integral part of the story.just imagine what could be achieved by using cgi in a remake of fingerbobs... the already disturbing hand antics of the bearded hippy, yoffi could take on a whole new level with a more life-like fingermousebob the builder, postman pat and fireman sam together in an epic adventure of fire, post and bricks. in the ultimate struggle to save the women they love from the evil clowns, krusty and gobo. will they triumph or will they fail miserably? find out this fall.one puppet show that i personally would love to see made into a live action movie is joe 90. it would be worth the price of admission alone to see the large screen version of joe's car. of course, gerry anderson's supermarionation is a rich seam of material worthy of big-screen, big-budget action. it was only that thunderbirds the movie was targetted as a children't movie that really let it down. after all, the children that remember those shows with such affection are now the parents of children themselves.it's only because the people who were children when these programmes were first shown have grown up and are plundering their childhoods, isn't it? i'd hate to see bagpuss with perfect animation - i love that 'done in a shed' clunkiness and you couldn't recreate the magic. perhaps if the remakes were done in a 'look around you' mock-authentic style i might be interested ...chorton and the wheelies or jamie and his magic torch; that would be mega!this re-gurgitation of old films and tv shows makes me angry - it is corporate laziness resting on the safety of other people's ideas, because it guarantees to bring in the $$$. the same can be said of modern day pop bands who release other peoples material, will young etc. the sad fact is nostalgia sells big bucks in the short-term. the fact that they will be forgotten in 6 months time is irrelevant (e.g. starsky & hutch) hence, the market is saturated with this mindless drivel, but it can only be stopped if people stop buying it!i pray they never do a remake of chorlton and the wheelies. i'm only 27 and don't remember the series from when it was on tv, but have the set on dvd and it's a classic. the fact it's so great comes from the fact that there were very few special effects involved and compared to today's stuff it looks amateurish. thats the appeal though, it's so innocent (like chorlton himself) and it would be a real shame if they did remake it.\n",

      "bollywood dvd fraudster is jaileda major distributor of pirated dvds of bollywood films has been sent to prison for three years.jayanti amarishi buhecha from cambridge was found guilty of two trademark offences last month, and sentenced at harrow crown court, london, on tuesday. buhecha, who made â£26,000 per month from his illegal trade, was called \"one of the biggest bollywood pirates in the uk\" by the sentencing judge. the british phonographic industry (bpi) worked for two years on the case.an operation was launched against buhecha in 2002 after complaints were received about his activities. the judge in the case, which lasted seven days, said that \"a heavy penalty was called for because of the enormous damage buhecha caused to legitimate business\". fake dvds were manufactured in pakistan and malaysia and sold on wholesale to shops by buhecha, who traded in conterfeit dvds in 2002 and 2003.in december 2002, he was stopped in his car by trading standards officers, who uncovered 1,000 pirated dvds and faked inlay cards printed with registered trademarks. despite being arrested and bailed, buhecha was caught a second time at the end of 2003. his home and a lock-up in cambridge were found to contain 18,000 counterfeit dvds and further faked inlay cards. buhecha was previously a legitimate distributor of bollywood films, but was suspended and sued by his employers for dealing in illegal copies of bollywood classic mohabbatein. legitimate bollywood film distributors have hailed the conviction as \"a major boost\". bollywood music and film suffers piracy at the rate of 40%, which is more than that suffered by mainstream productions. the bpi welcomed the news of the prison sentence, but warned there are plenty of other active counterfeiters of bollywood films. the organisation's anti-piracy director david martin said: \"the problem simply will not disappear with buhecha. others and more will take his place, so it's vital that keep up our efforts in this field.\"\n",
      "us 'afflicted' with awards fatiguethe film world and media may be wild about the oscars but cinema-goers and the tv-viewing public are sick of watching award ceremonies, according to some la film critics.bob strauss, from the la daily news, thinks there are just too many televised gatherings of stars showering praise on each other. he came up with a colourful but unprintable description for these glitzy events, which roughly translates a \"celebrity love-in\". this echoed the views of oscars host and comedian chris rock, who whipped up a media storm for saying he rarely watched them, calling award shows \"idiotic\". \"as chris rock accurately said, they're about celebrity and fashion,\" mr strauss said. the recent grammy music awards proved to be a ratings loser, and it seems oscars organisers are determined not to go the same way.recently announced changes to the ceremony include lining up all five nominees on stage before announcing the winner.unsurprisingly, this prompted press speculation that the changes were aimed at boosting flagging advertising revenue. but entertainment weekly's dave karger maintained the oscars only generated excitement outside the industry when a blockbuster, such as titanic or lord of the rings, was nominated. the near constant flow of us film awards, representing directors, actors and producers' guilds, also means \"few surprises\" are left by the time the oscar ceremony is upon us, he said. a quick scan of the los angeles times and los angeles daily news bears this out - speculation about who will win seems to have ground to a halt.on thursday, the times simply printed a picture of the plastic tents going up outside the kodak theatre to protect the red carpet from rain. variety and the hollywood reporter have also kept their focus firmly on industry-related news, while in the uk bets have closed on the best actor category, with ray star jamie foxx a dead cert to win.screen international's us editor mike goodridge thinks 2004's films have simply not grabbed the public's imagination. \"film-makers haven't produced films that people adore this year,\" he said. \"they adored saving private ryan for example - people loved it and it made a ton of money. \"2004's films could be a reaction to 9/11 - there was a realisation in america that things might not be so rosy after all. \"audiences don't necessarily want to see darker films such as million dollar baby, aviator and finding neverland, which end with casualty.\" as to whether rock could pep up the awards, the critics were not hopeful.mr strauss doubted whether rock would make an impact, but added: \"i'm all for lower ratings though - there are far more important things going on than the oscars.\" mr karger said the comic might boost younger viewers, but mike goodridge thought rock's humour could prompt america's conservative states to switch off. so despite all this, did the critics have any views on who would win?\"clint eastwood's million dollar baby affected people emotionally, which is why it will beat aviator, which was about technical artistry not feelings,\" mr karger said. \"eastwood has it in the bag,\" added mr strauss. \"oscar voters often vote with their hearts not their heads.\" and mr goodridge said best film and director were between martin scorsese's aviator and million dollar baby. mr karger, whose favourite film of the year was mike leigh's abortion drama vera drake, stayed upbeat about the awards despite his other comments. \"i hope this is the year for small films to triumph,\" he said. \"after all, it's still one of the biggest tv events of the year.\"\n",

      "jackson film 'absolute disaster'a pr expert has told the michael jackson child abuse trial that the tv documentary at the heart of the case was an \"absolute disaster\".ann kite told the court in the californian town of santa maria she was hired to \"crisis manage\" the fallout after the programme had aired in 2003. jurors saw the film, in which the pop star held hands with the alleged victim, on tuesday. mr jackson denies 10 charges of child abuse and false imprisonment. if convicted, he could face up to 21 years in prison.ms kite suggested jackson's associates had been intent on launching a smear campaign against the accuser's family after the airing of martin bashir's film living with michael jackson. she told the court that in the aftermath of the broadcast, a jackson lawyer had told her the boy's mother would be made to look like a \"crack whore\". jackson's defence questioned ms kite's credibility, pointing that she worked for the singer's team for less than a week before being fired, and had never met or spoken to the star.ms kite said she received a phone call on 13 february 2003 from a jackson associate, marc schaffel, who said the boy and his family had left the neverland ranch where they had been staying.ms kite told the court she had later asked jackson's lawyer, david legrand, what had happened. \"i said, `don't make me believe that these people were hunted down like dogs and brought back to the ranch',\" she said. ms kite began to work for mr jackson in february 2003, after the controversial film was televised in the us and europe. the documentary sparked a media storm and the subsequent investigation into mr jackson's relationship with the boy. in the film, the singer said he did not see anything wrong with sharing a bed with a child.questioned by the prosecution, ms kite said her plan had been to move media coverage of the star away from a focus on his human frailties to concentrate more on his musical genius. ms kite said that an additional problem was the release of documents relating to a previous allegation of child abuse against mr jackson. the smoking gun website publication was \"beyond disaster\", ms kite said. correspondents say the reference is important because it was unclear whether the prosecution would be able to bring up the previous case in front of the jury.the judge is studying whether the prosecution's first witness, reporter martin bashir, is in contempt of court. the defence protested after mr bashir, who interviewed jackson for the tv documentary, refused to answer nearly all their questions, citing a california \"shield\" law intended to allow journalists to protect their sources. in the prosecution's opening statement on monday, tom sneddon told the court that mr jackson had shown the boy porn and plied him with wine, in order to molest him. he said the singer had visited sexually explicit websites and showed the boy - who was 13 at the time - and his younger brother pornography at his ranch.\n",

      "women mps reveal sexist tauntswomen mps endure \"shocking\" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.male mps pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered \"melons\" as women made commons speeches, researchers from birkbeck college were told. labour's yvette cooper said she found it hard to persuade commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. some 83 mps gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study \"whose secretary are you, minister\".the research team, under professor joni lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at westminster. but what emerged was complaints from mps of all parties of sexist barracking in the chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. barbara follet, one of the so-called \"blair babes\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \"i remember some conservatives - whenever a labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke.\" former liberal democrat mp jackie ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading mp on topics such as women's legs or their sexual persuasion. and ex-tory education secretary gillian shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \"betty\".\"when i said, 'look you know my name isn't betty', he said, 'ah but you're all the same, so i call you all betty'.\" harriet harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the cabinet: \"well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman.\" another current member of the cabinet says she was told: \"oh, you've had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?\" even after the great influx of women mps at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the cabinet, female mps often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.liberal democrat sarah teather, the most recent female mp to be elected, told researchers: \"lots of people say it's like an old boys club. \"i've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers.\" prof joni lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of margaret moran mp and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. \"we expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. we expected to find a couple of shocking episodes.\" but she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. this was mainly because there were more women present in parliament who were not prepared to \"put up with\" the sexist attitudes they came across, prof lovenduski said. but she added: \"some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and i am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. \"what i think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the house of commons.\" the interviews are to be placed in the british library as a historical record.\n",

      "nat insurance to rise, say toriesnational insurance will be raised if labour wins the next election, tory leader michael howard has claimed.tony blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other tax promises would be left to labour's manifesto. prime minister's questions also saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. he attacked tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but mr howard said labour had proposed the idea too.the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. the tories have promised â£4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. mr howard pointed to the institute for fiscal studies' predictions that labour will need to increase taxes to cover an â£11bn gap in its spending plans. he accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued mr howard. pointing to national insurance, he added: \"everyone knows tax will go up under labour: isn't it now clear which tax it would be?\"mr blair instead hailed labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. \"when we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,\" he said. on the tax questions, he added: \"we will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.\" home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the uk from outside the european union.mr blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. that would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. he challenged the tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a \"fantasy island\". mr howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the european council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu. but mr blair said: \"all the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the un.\"\n",

      "uk 'needs true immigration data'a former home office minister has called for an independent body to be set up to monitor uk immigration.barbara roche said an organisation should monitor and publish figures and be independent of government. she said this would counter \"so-called independent\" groups like migration watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. migration watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures. sir andrew green, chairman of the organisation, says there is no need for an independent body because office of national statistics data are accurate. he says he opposes large-scale immigration \"both on the grounds of overcrowding and culture\".he said: \"for example, over the next 20 years one household in three will be due to immigration. \"we are already more overcrowded than india and we are four times more overcrowded than france.\" ms roche, labour mp for hornsey and wood green, believes legal migration is something we should welcome. she said her proposals mean \"we wouldn't have so-called independent experts, like migration watch, who come into this debate from an anti-immigration point of view.\" she went on: \"what i would like to see is there being a body which actually looked at the figures, published them, and was independent of government. \"i think that would go a long way to allaying some of the fears that are sometimes whipped up during this debate.\"\n",

      "butler launches attack on blairformer civil service chief lord butler has criticised the way tony blair's government operates, accusing it of being obsessed with headlines.he also attacked the way the iraq war was \"sold\" to the public, with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. tory leader michael howard said lord butler had given the \"most damaging testimony\" he could remember. but downing street said mr blair should be judged by results not his style.lord butler said mr blair bypassed the cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. the prime minister's official spokesman said the cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. but he added: \"you cannot, in a modern government, take every decision in cabinet. it's just not possible.\"lord butler said the government had too much freedom to \"bring in bad bills\" and \"to do whatever it likes\" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. the former cabinet secretary said in an interview with the spectator magazine: \"i would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling, there is too much central control and there is too little of what i would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments.\" mr howard described lord butler's intervention as \"very important\". \"this is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the blair government. \"it is certainly the most damaging testimony i can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.\"lord butler's report earlier this year into iraq intelligence said the government's september 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that saddam hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was \"very thin\". the reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war, lord butler said in his spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine's editor, conservative mp boris johnson. he said: \"when civil servants give material to ministers, they say these are the conclusions we've drawn, but we've got to tell you the evidence we've got is pretty thin. \"similarly, if you are giving something to the united nations and the country you should warn them.\"asked why he thought the warnings were not there lord butler said: \"one has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. the purpose of the dossier was to persuade the british why the government thought iraq was a very serious threat.\"when asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: \"well. i think we are a country where we suffer very badly from parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. \"we should be breaking away from the party whip. the executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad bills, a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. \"all that is part of what is bad government in this country.\" lord butler's assessment was backed by his predecessor as cabinet secretary, lord armstrong. lord armstrong told bbc two's newsnight: \"i agree ... there doesn't appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect.\" liberal democrat deputy leader menzies campbell said he thought lord butler's comments were \"well justified\" and mr blair's style of leadership was \"corrosive of the whole system of government\". but labour former minister jack cunningham accused lord butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary. mr cunningham told bbc radio 4's today programme: \"taken together, robin butler's comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the labour government.\"\n",

      "uk set to cut back on embassiesnine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money, uk foreign secretary jack straw has announced.the bahamas, east timor, madagascar and swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shake-up for the diplomatic service for years. other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. mr straw said the move would save â£6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism.honorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed, mostly in europe and america.they include dallas in the us, bordeaux in france and oporto in portugal, with local staff replacing uk representation in another 11. the changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006, with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. in a written statement, mr straw said: \"the savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the foreign and commonwealth office's strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. \"some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. \"in africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in nigeria to cover energy and one in pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering maseru and mbabane.\"the foreign office currently has about 6,100 uk-based staff. it has opened major new missions on baghdad and basra in iraq, kabul in afghanistan and pyongyang in north korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding wednesday's cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. the shake-up is aimed at helping making â£86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. the chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. \"but the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that british commercial interests and the interests of britons abroad will not be adversely affected,\" he said.\n",
      "labour targets 'hardcore truants'a fresh crackdown on persistent truants in england has been launched by education secretary ruth kelly.serial truants make up one in 13 pupils. previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics. parenting contracts, penalty notices and \"fast track\" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. it is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. tories say labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school. such absences are often due to family holidays.however, serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing â£885m. those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. in one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved. the tough stance paid off with just 24 issued, while attendance improved in 776 cases. truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's behaviour improvement programme. this is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since september.the new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on monday. police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school. in almost 14,000 of those cases, the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. a department for education and skills source said: \"every day in school counts. \"it is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy.\"\n",
      "blunkett sorry over murder plandavid blunkett has apologised to mps after the home office announced \"prematurely\" via press release a review of murder laws.the home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a law commission report which branded the current murder law as \"a mess\". he said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. the home office has already said the review will begin next year.on wednesday, a home office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only england and wales. news of the review was released because it was thought mr blunkett would make the official announcement in a commons debate on wednesday. but the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. amid opposition anger, mr blunkett had to answer an emergency question in parliament on thursday. he said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. shadow home secretary david davis welcomed his \"gracious apology\" and the review itself. but he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to face mps.in its report, the law commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. the panel suggested different kinds of murders could be \"graded\" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.but the home office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. the commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. but it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was \"indefensible and should cease\".a key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. the commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. but speaking after the report was published, home office minister baroness scotland said: \"murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. \"where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence.\" the commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.\n",

      "tories attack burglar 'u-turns'tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing u-turns over rules on using force against burglars.the government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows \"reasonable force\" in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: \"it is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars.\" home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using \"grossly disproportionate\" force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps: \"if we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law.\" instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday, mr howard told bbc radio 4's today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said: \"we've had three policy positions in three months and two u-turns. \"it's not surprising gordon brown told him: 'there's nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe.'\"mr howard said the \"grossly disproportionate\" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were \"weighted overwhelmingly\" in favour of the householder, said mr clarke. he said: \"the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making.\" the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions, ken macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. tory mp patrick mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.\n",
      "leaders meet over turkish eu bidtony blair has met italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schroeder to talk about turkey entering the eu.the downing street talks covered a range of other topics ahead of an eu summit in brussels later in the week. mr blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring turkey within the recently-expanded eu. italy and germany also favour an early start to talks, but there is scepticism in france and elsewhere. some are worried that turkey's large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the eu difficult.some are concerned that a change of government could lead to turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. and many in france would prefer turkey to admit that world war i-era killing of armenians constituted genocide. there are also issues in france and the netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major muslim nation into the eu. but mr blair and the labour government have been the staunchest backers of turkish accession, provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. mr blair's official spokesman said: \"the prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of european councils. \"the key issue at this week's council will be that of turkey, but they will also discuss a range of other matters.\"\n",
      "choose hope over fear - kennedyvoters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said charles kennedy.in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and \"populist scares\". he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. on the asian tsunami he said it had been \"very heartening\" to learn of the generosity being shown by britons. mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the christmas and new year period. at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.the general election would be a three-party struggle, as the conservative party \"fades away\" as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands, he said. \"a clear division is emerging in british politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. \"labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity. while the conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the european 'menace',\" he said. he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison, ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and id card plans. he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. \"but at the same time, an overmighty state is a dangerous one,\" he said. his party \"instinctively\" understood the \"new liberal britain\" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said. \"we are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. \"our national institutions are changing too. we are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. in our attitudes and the way we live our lives, this is in many ways a liberal britain.\""

      "mr hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses.but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place.as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped.spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent.while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too.in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate.for instance, said mr hogan, filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.anti-spam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail.\n",

      "but currently, putting a master feature film onto dvd requires severe compression because current dvd technology cannot hold as much as high-definition films demand.what high-definition revolution ultimately means is that the line between home entertainment and cinema worlds will blur.currently, an entire dvd project can take up to three months, says mr dean.but when high-definition films do come out on the new format dvds, it will profoundly change home entertainment.those costs could filter down to the price ticket on a high-definition dvd.first it was the humble home video, then it was the dvd, and now hollywood is preparing for the next revolution in home entertainment - high-definition.and if studios do focus on delivering more \"added value content\", thinks mr dean, ultimately it could mean that they will want more money for it.high-definition throws up other challenge to film makers and dvd production alike.it will take time though to persuade people who spent money on dvd players to buy the different players and displays required to watch high-definition dvds in 18 months' time.high-definition dvds can hold up to six times more data than the dvds we are used to.mr dean is confident though: \"i think if they see real hd [high-definition], not some heavily compressed version of it, there is such a remarkable difference.high-definition will mean some changes for those working behind the scenes too.on the whole, producing films for high-definition dvds will be easier in some ways because less compression is needed.equally, it may mean hollywood studios ask for more to be put onto the average dvd.\"in the hd version of episode i, all these make-up lines showed up,\" explains mr dean.\"when we master movies right now, our data rates are running at about 1.2 gigabits per second,\" says mr dean.\"the film that we see in theatres is coming from the same digital file that we take the home video master,\" he says.if studios want to cash in on the extra space, it could mean extra human hours, for which someone has to pay.\n",

      "already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.\"windows cash machines have been around for several years,\" he said.the many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously, he said.\"this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system,\" he said.this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network.mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were windows based.already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system.but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.incidents like this happen, said mr thiemann, because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers.todd thiemann, spokesman for anti-virus firm trend micro, said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks.in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce.currently, he said, a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year.\n",

      "san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.and the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre, setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission.you control a character, on this occasion a youth named cj, who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive 3d environment.san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.the 18 certificate gta: san andreas for the playstation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach.cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane.at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, san andreas' violence, or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence, are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade.instead, it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps, carefree, over all the driv3r and true crime-shaped opposition.it is a testament to san andreas' magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws, but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don't detract.the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas, comprising three major cities: los santos, which is a thinly-disguised los angeles, san fierro, aka san francisco and las venturas, a carbon copy of las vegas.the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game.its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold, assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city.the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart.a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options, where gta games' trademark humour is anchored.the basic gameplay remains familiar.developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality, and in some respects ramp it up from past outings.but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive.\n",

      "but, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble.armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name.fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files.the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data.and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name.after all, i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems.and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details.the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net, argues analyst bill thompson.the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities.whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused?any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it.the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft.i doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future.in fact i do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.\n",

      "in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false.before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played.game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally.experts said the success of the half-life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version.half-life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online.about 20,000 people have been banned from playing the half-life 2 game.unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts.if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems.authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run.\n",

      "i have never really approved of using the internet protocol (ip), to do either audio or video streaming, and i think that technically it is a disaster to make phone calls over the net using \"voice over ip\".with vodafone now pushing its own 3g service, and 3 already established in the uk, video on the phone is clearly going to become a must-have for kids sitting on the school bus, adults waiting outside clubs and anyone who has time to kill and a group of friends to impress.i bought my son max a 3g phone, partly because they are so cheap and he needed a phone, and partly because i am supposed to know about the latest technology and thought i should see how they work in real life.but we should not see these new phones simply as cut-down network terminals.but just as the world wide web was the \"killer application\" that drove internet adoption, music videos are going to drive 3g adoption.but 3g networks have been designed to do this sort of streaming, both for voice and video, which gives them an edge over net-based ip services.3g phones and ipods can co-exist, at least for a while, but if i had to bet on the long term i would go for content on demand over carrying gigabytes in my pocket.by contrast the confusing menus, complicated keyboard and truly irritating user interface of max's 3g phone simply get in the way, and i did not see much value in the paid-for services, especially the limited web access.if i want fast access to my e-mail i can get a 3g card for my laptop or hook up to a wireless network.but it goes deeper than that: playing music videos on a phone marks the beginning of a move away from the 'download and play' model we have all accepted for our ipods and mp3 players.i am even playing with internet telephony, despite my reservations, and i appear on go digital on the world service, streamed over the web each week.the 3g services aren't quite there yet, and there is a lot to be sorted out when it comes to web access and data charges.after using it for a while i am not at all tempted to get rid of my sonyericsson p800 smart phone.the quality was at least as good as the video streaming from the bbc website, and the image is about the same size.it is certainly not a great overall experience, but that is largely due to the poor menu system and the phone layout: the video content itself is compelling.\n",
      "the first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and professor reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might.prof reddy says he hopes to lease the pctvts for about $10 a month, and thinks indians will rent the units for the television and dvd capabilities.\"it must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this,\" prof reddy says.\"i come from a village,\" says prof reddy, \"i know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns.\"reddy says he can then introduce the pctvt's other technologies - such as video mail.carnegie mellon professor raj reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people.prof reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off.prof reddy has teamed up with eric brewer at the university of california at berkeley.instead, prof reddy decided to think of those 250 million indians as a potential market.many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a tv.you might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer.\"so it's clear to me that if people wanted to use pcs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice.\"prof reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach.prassana rambathla, one of prof reddy's graduate students, says that \"when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.'after all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world?if you go to india, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal.this dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a phd.the answer, says prof brewer, is wi-fi.and now, an indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet.\n",

      "dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.however, he said, now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month.dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop.dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles.for the study, ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.dr bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.by contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.while diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form.\"historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said dr michael bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab.another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists.one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said.\"they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\"people's habits remain the same,\" said dr bjorn.\n",

      "what this means, said stacey jolna, senior vice president of tv guide tv group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for tv viewers.these set-top boxes, like the us's tivo and the uk's sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind tv programmes when they want.essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised tv.with home theatre systems, plasma high-definition tvs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch tv will be radically different in five years' time.it means that networks, in us terms, or channels could take a leaf out of google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch.high-definition tv sets are everywhere and many new models of lcd (liquid crystal display) tvs have been launched with dvr capability built into them, instead of being external boxes.one such example launched at the show is humax's 26-inch lcd tv with an 80-hour tivo dvr and dvd recorder.one of the us's biggest satellite tv companies, directtv, has even launched its own branded dvr at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function.all these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.but some us networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as \"brand identity\" and viewer loyalty to channels.with the us leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.they perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, mr hanlon suggested.one of the most talked-about technologies of ces has been digital and personal video recorders (dvr and pvr).\n",

      "dr bjorn said that people also used their camera phones in very different ways to film and even digital cameras.however, he said, now 45% of the japanese people ericsson questioned use their camera phone at least once a month.dr bjorn said that early reports of camera phone usage in japan seemed to imply that the innovation was going to be a flop.dr bjorn said that although consumers do what they always did but use a phone to do it, the sheer variety of what the new handset technologies make possible does gradually drive new habits and lifestyles.for the study, ericsson interviewed 14,000 mobile phone owners on the ways they use their phone.dr bjorn said groups dubbed \"pioneers\" and \"materialists\" were most interested in trying new things and were behind the start of many trends in phone use.by contrast, he said, camera phones were being used much more to capture a moment and were being woven into everyday life.while diaries have always been popular, a mobile phone -- especially one equipped with a camera -- helps them keep it in a different form.\"historically in the industry there has been too much focus on using technology,\" said dr michael bjorn, senior advisor on mobile media at ericsson's consumer and enterprise lab.another factor governing the speed of change in mobile phone use was the simple speed with which new devices are bought by pioneers and materialists.one good example of this was diary-writing among younger people, he said.\"they just move the activity into the mobile phone as it's a much more convenient way to do it.\"\"people's habits remain the same,\" said dr bjorn.\n",

      "part of the reason that these \"bot nets\" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created.by contrast, said mr hogan, the code for viruses such as gaobot, spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time.one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus, said kevin hogan, senior manager in symantec's security response group.mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in \"bot nets\" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.on the positive side, finnish security firm f-secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers.the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004.although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said mr hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs.in total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29a virus writing group were sentenced.the count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%.the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month.this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages.virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum.\"in june, the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology.\"they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses,\" said mr hogan.\"that's unprecedented,\" said mr hogan.\n",

      "the inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said mr purushotma.one of the drawbacks of the sims, said mr purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation.the incidental information about what a sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said mr purushotma.the hard part of learning any language, said mr purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences.but, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as the sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game.by contrast, said mr purushotma, learning via something like the sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all.a us researcher has suggested that games such as the sims could be a good way to teach languages.\"the way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity,\" he said.this could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons.although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, mr purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes.but instead of fearing computer games, ravi purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games.\n",

      "instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats.he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy.shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers.\"not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said.in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\".ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.\"in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying.the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft.the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought.\n",
      "but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content, said travis kalanick, founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh, and soon they are all going to want a slice of it.once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year, firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology.the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks.since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down, the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology, blaming it for falling sales and piracy.it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them.\"we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p,\" said marc morgenstern, vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer.but, until the legal actions are resolved, experimentation with p2p cannot not happen, said michael weiss, president of streamcast networks.\"increasingly, what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content,\" said derek broes, from microsoft.p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file, like photos, free software, licensed music and any other digital content.the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january.but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations.looking into p2p's future, file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks, as far as mr broes is concerned.but such download services are very different from p2p networks, not least because of the financial aspect.\"they will probably pay an increasing role in helping p2p spread,\" he said.peer-to-peer (p2p) networks are here to stay, and are on the verge of being exploited by commercial media firms, says a panel of industry experts.unsigned bands, for example, use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively, which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign.\n",

      "instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers.by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats.he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy.shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers.\"not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,\" he said.in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy \"appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content\".ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop.confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple.\"in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past,\" said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research.the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying.the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft.the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought.\n",

      "the difference this next generation standard, ipv6, will make to the average net user is almost invisible.ipv6, the standard that will replace the existing ipv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world.\"i think voip (voice-over internet protocol, allowing phone calls to be made over the net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms,\" says dr carpenter.standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task.\"the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate,\" explained dr carpenter.technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled, said dr carpenter.the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work, are open and free for anyone to use and work with.at cern, dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web, so he is well-placed to take on such a task.\"given it [the net] was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions.with broadband take-up growing, services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net.the net's growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf.as the new chair of the ietf, his next big challenge is overseeing ipv6, the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web.\"the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s.\"in a sense, we have hardly started in reaching the whole population,\" the new chair of the internet engineering task force (ietf), brian carpenter, says.\"we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards.\"it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits,\" said dr carpenter.when computers communicate with the net, a unique ip address is used to send and receive information.the body that oversees how the net works, grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years, but it is just the start.that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies, like china, which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies.\n",

      "this goes to the heart of the european project, and even those who do not care about software or patents should be worried.but small companies, and the free and open software movement do not have any patents to trade.more directly, once software patents are granted then any programmer will have to worry that the code they are writing is infringing someone else's patent.they have legal departments and, more crucially, patents of their own which they can trade or cross-license with other patent holders.a new european directive could put software writers at risk of legal action, warns former programmer and technology analyst bill thompson.the same does not hold for a patent.after all, how much fuss can you generate about the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions, and the way it amends article 52 of the 1973 european patent convention?if the directive goes through it has to be written into national laws and then there will be a steady stream of legal actions against small companies and open source products.it is a small invention, but amazon made it to the patent office first and now owns it.much of the really useful software we use every day, programs like the apache web server, the gnu/linux operating system and the fearsomely popular firefox browser, is developed outside company structures by people who do not have legal departments to check for patent infringements.the new proposals go back to 2002, although argument about patentability of software and computer-implemented inventions has been going on since at least the mid-1980s.if it gets its way, the dutch government will conclude its presidency of the european union by pushing through a controversial measure that has been rejected by the european parliament, lacks majority support from national governments and will leave millions of european citizens in legal limbo and facing the possibility of court cases against them.the new directive will limit innovation by forcing programmers to spend time checking for patent infringements or simply avoiding working in potentially competitive areas.it will let large companies patent all sorts of ideas and give legal force to those who want to limit their competitors' use of really obvious ideas.the proposed directive is supported by many of the major software companies, but this is hardly surprising since most of them are us-based and they have already had to cope with a legal environment that allows patents.many observers of the computing scene, including myself, think the results will be disastrous for small companies, innovative programmers and the free and open source software movement.if it was pointed out that one of my articles contained a substantial chunk of the poem then i could defend myself in court by claiming that i had simply made it up and it was coincidence.a patent gives the owner the right to stop anyone else using their invention, even if the other person invented it separately.\n",
      "amit yoran was director of the national cyber security division within the us department of homeland security created following the 9/11 attacks.the cyber security division also audited us government networks to discover exactly what was sitting on which network.mr yoran took up his post in september 2003 and his first task was to get the cyber security division up and running.mr yoran's division was also doing work to identify the networks and machines that had been broken into by cyber criminals.the division was tasked with improving us defences against malicious hackers, viruses and other net-based threats.reports suggest he left because his division was not given enough clout within the larger organisation.some reports have suggested that mr yoran felt frustrated by the lack of prominence given to work to protect against net-based threats in the wider homeland organisation.\n",
      "he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour \"wasn't that unusual; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much\".i think i'm obsessed with gaming in general, i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to, i'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united.i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct.he quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than everquest.having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking.i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...  as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively.this game dominated 2 years of my life.24hours, when i was a kid at school and i was on half term, ultima online was the game, ahhhh them was the days !\"the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game.online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality.some of the comments were humorous: \"this game is so good i'm not going to get it, there's no way i could limit the hours i'd spend playing it,\" wrote charles macintyre, from england.i play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but i don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.when you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.however, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent.the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of \"hardcore gaming\" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game.but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game (mmorpg): \"'you need to get out more' could be the motto of any mmorpg.it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are \"easier\" and more fun than the real world.it's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life...\"an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,\" wrote travis anderson, in texas.whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv.great game!can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something i'm increasingly concerned with...  me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv, trying to 'frag' some individual.i am obsessed with online role playing games.massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds.obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem.sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, i find myself longing to have the time to join them.most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.e hayot, writing in the culture blogzine print culture, said recently: \"i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot.i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex.the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session.i know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing warcraft.it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one.online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others.in a game where you will never complete an \"ultimate\" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit.a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...  championship manager consumed my life for years.when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i'm trying not to spend so much time on there.i have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer.seven years ago, i began playing ultima online.when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning.i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the european version (couldn't help myself).an 11 hour stretch isn't that surprising - i've known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch.i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isn't.gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far.the scope of these games - like warcraft, everquest, ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite.when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres.nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games, and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.\"you lie; you don't go into work because you \"had stuff to do at home\"; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching tv (a good thing, presumably),\" he wrote, explaining how everquest took over his time.furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.another correspondent wrote: \"i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness.\"from morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink.despite having little monetary value, the \"rewards\" and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily.the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.unfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make.\"i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality,\" she said.scare-mongering articles about \"addictive video games\" have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices.when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5:pm.and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level.\n"
